    <p>This is an archive of <a href="https://middangeard.org.uk/aglardh/">Tamas Ferencz</a>’s Google Plus community “Languages of Middle-Earth” (aka LoME),
that existed from December 2012 until November 2018 when Google Plus was shut down for private customers.
This archive is an extraction of all posts in this group to keep the contributions to Eldarin scholarship
accessible. The options to navigate this archive are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/lome-archive/all.html"><strong>All Posts:</strong></a> All the posts in chronological order. Probably
not very useful for most purposes. There are 1263 posts in this archive.</li>
  <li><a href="/lome-archive/tags.html"><strong>Tags and Users:</strong></a> Collections of all posts in which a
particular user participated or was mentioned or a particular #Hastag has been used.</li>
  <li><a href="/lome-archive/search.html"><strong>Search:</strong></a> A simple search function for the archive.
It is not particularly clever (e. g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Namarie</code> won’t find entries with <em>Namárie</em>), 
if you don’t find what you are looking for, use the <em>Advanced Search</em>
button which produces a search engine query to DuckDuckGo with your input.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have old G+ links to a post, here is how you can find it in this archive. All links have a
post ID as their last element:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://plus.google.com/+TamasFerencz/posts/<strong>i2HPLGKqUHA</strong></li>
  <li>https://plus.google.com/112231085503313590007/posts/<strong>54S5sjuB4Z7</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In this case the post IDs are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i2HPLGKqUHA</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">54S5sjuB4Z7</code>. You can enter those IDs
on the <a href="/lome-archive/search.html">search page</a> to find the appropriate post.
It has been tried to modify the G+ links on an archive page so that they link to the
corresponding location in the archive rather than to the old G+ page, but this does not
work for every possible link. If you get redirected to a site informing you that G+ is
no longer available for private customers, please use the manual method described above
to get to the reverenced post. Sometimes the posts will reference images that were uploaded
to G+, but these are not included in this archive, since they are missing from
<a href="https://middangeard.org.uk/aglardh/index.php/node/41">Tamas Ferencz’s backup</a>. All Tags and
usernames should work though.</p>

<p>The content in this archive has been created by the former members of the G+ group
and it was not possible to read all of them, if you encounter any offensive content,
please message me. Also, for that same reason be careful about opening links that
have been created by the users and always check the link URL before opening them.
Those external links are shown <a class="ext-link" href="#">in red</a>, as opposed to those
<a href="#">in blue</a> or <span class="tag-preview"><a href="">in grey</a></span>,
which will lead to pages within this archive.</p>

<p>It has been impossible to seek out every member of this community to ask them for
permission to republish its contents. However as this has been a scholarly group
discussing Tolkien’s languages and should not have contained much “personal” content
I think this is acceptable. If you want your posts removed, please message me</p>

<ul>
  <li>by opening a <a href="https://github.com/j-teuber/lome-archive/issues/new/choose">GitHub issue</a>,</li>
