(Properly, <i>quen</i> might only be applicable to persons that speak with rational words, but because of informality and personification it seems appropriate.) Since all of these are still a bit long in syllable count for quick informal usage, I often use a short form <i>Tyalven</i> '(female) playmate, (lit.) play-maiden' (fitting as she is very playful).<br><br><i>Tyalven as amilerya:</i></div>

        <div class="content">Names are very personal things so I will not comment on them specifically, but these two examples have made me wonder about a couple things:<br>- we now also have the verbal suffix -ite to express adjectives with a general relation to the verb, like karaite "busy, active = full of activity". So with roots like TYAL we can have the pair of adjectives tyalinqua and tyalaite, one coming from the noun, the other from the verb. Would there be (or can we assign) any difference in their meanings, or would both essentially mean "playful"?<br><br>- the other thing is, do we actually know whether suffixing a noun with -ince the final vowel is automatically dropped? The attested examples we have (atarince, cirince etc.) are not conclusive, and arpoince wouldn't be against Q phonology, would it?</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#björn-fromén">Björn Fromén</a> indeed - I could even imagine -ince being attached to vowels via a connecting consonant like the -l connecting -ima to verbs ending in -a.

        <div class="content">There is good insight here, even when source info is scarce. The <i>-ite</i> suffix is a good tool to remember. Compounding is to me one of the most interesting parts of Q and learning more about it seems important. Thanks, Tamas and Björn!</div>
