        <div class="content">Hi folks,<br><br>I've been working on a multi-language Elvish lexicon for some time now, based on an XML data model used to generate entries for individual words and names, as well as their relationships. It covers both early and later versions of the languages (Early/Middle/Late Quenya, Gnomish/Noldorin/Sindarin) and includes data for the main works (LotR, Silmarillion, History of Middle Earth series), most issues of Vinyar Tengwar, as well as the major vocabulary lists from the Etymologies and Parma Eldalamberon issues 11, 12 and 17.<br><br>It is still a work in progress, and is very far from being "done" (assuming such a thing is even possible), but it has finally reached a point where I think it might be useful to others as well as myself.<br><br>The lexicon is here:<br><br><a class="ext-link" href="http://eldamo.sourceforge.net/">http://eldamo.sourceforge.net/</a><br><br>You can also down the files from here:<br><br><a class="ext-link" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/eldamo/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/eldamo/</a></div>

        <div class="content">Thanks to you both. The current version is by no means complete, since I have quite a few issues of Parma Eldalamberon to get through.

        <div class="content">One thing I noticed: You need to distinguish Doriathrin from Sindarin. "Dagnir Glaurunga" is Doriathrin (a middle-period language) phrase, and I don't see it in the list of middle-period languages.</div>

        <div class="content">I lumped Doriathrin together with Ilkorin in the middle-period languages. Since they are very similar, I found it easier to analyze them as dialects of the same language.<br><br>As for "Dagnir Glaurunga", since it made it into the published Silmarillion, I assumed it was dialectical or archaic Sindarin. There are a couple places where Tolkien indicated that Sindarin may have had an archaic genitive suffix "-a" (PE17/97, VT42/4).<br><br>I haven't fully analyzed the Sindarin phrases, though, so will likely make notes on the different theories when I get to it.</div>

        <div class="content">Johnathon, feel free to use the XML data in Eldamo however you see fit. I put it in the most liberal Creative Commons license for a reason. If you have an existing data set that you are willing to share, I'd be happy to look at it.
