        <div class="content">Another exploration of words, this time “letter, line, write”. This is a bit different from my previous examinations, since the most of the words in question are not in dispute, but their etymologies underwent quite a few changes.<br><br>The Eldarin words for “letter” are Q. <i>tengwa</i> and S. <i>têw</i> (WJ/396, PE17/44). Tolkien occasionally considered using S. <i>tîw</i> instead (PE22/149, Ety/TEK), but <i>têw</i> is by far the most frequent form, with <i>tîw</i> being reserved for the plural, most notably in the Moria Gate inscription: <i>Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin</i>.<br><br>In the Etymologies of the 1930s, ᴹQ. <i>tengwa</i> was derived from the root TEK “make a mark, write” from primitive <i>tekmā</i>. This derivation relied on the phonology change whereby a voiceless stop were first voiced and later became nasalized before nasals (PE19/43), so that tekmā > tegmā > teñma > tengwa (PE19/43), a development that survived into Tolkien’s later writings (PE17/43).<br><br>But at some point in the 1950s, Tolkien decided to change the phonetic development of voiceless stops before nasals in Quenya, so that the nasal was unvoiced instead (PE19/85). The result was that primitive <i>tm</i> became <i>tw</i> in Quenya, not <i>ngw</i>, and TEK could no longer be the root for <i>tengwa</i>. As part of revising the etymology of <i>tengwa</i> and <i>têw</i>, Tolkien shuffled various forms and meanings between several associated roots.<br><br>In the original scenario of the Etymologies, the roots for “line” and “write” were TEÑ (<< TEƷ) and TEK respectively. In addition to “letter”, the derivatives of TEK included the words for “pen” (ᴹQ. <i>tekil</i>, N. <i>tegol</i>), the verb for “write” (ᴹQ. <i>tek-</i>, N. <i>teitha-</i>), and the word for a diacritic mark (ᴹQ. <i>tehta</i>, N. <i>teith</i>). The derivatives of TEÑ included the words for “line” (ᴹQ. <i>tie</i>, N. <i>tê</i>), “straight” (ᴹQ. <i>téra</i>, N. <i>taer</i> or <i>tîr</i>) and “row” (ᴹQ. <i>téma</i>, N. <i>tî</i>). Interesting, the Noldorin word for “alphabet” was derived from a combination of both roots: <i>tiwdi</i> = <i>tîw</i> + <i>tî</i> = “letters row”.<br><br>In the 1950s, Tolkien needed a new etymology for <i>tengwa</i>, but couldn’t simply revise TEK, because some of its other derivatives had already appeared in LotR, notably S. <i>teitha-</i> “write” from the Moria Gate inscription as noted above. Instead, he revised the meaning of the root TEÑ to be “show, indicate, signify” (PE17/44, WJ/394). This new root became the basis for “letter”, with a primitive form of <i>teñmā</i> or <i>teñwā</i>. It also had some new derivatives such as Q. <i>tëa-</i> “indicate” (VT39/6) and Q. <i>tenna</i> “thought, notion, idea” (PE19/97).<br><br>[Note that Tolkien also briefly considered using TEW (PE17/44), but since the other later derivatives given above could not come from this root, it seems to have been a transient idea.]<br><br>The revised definition for TEÑ meant it could no longer be the basis for words related to “line”. Tolkien seems to have devised yet another new root for these words: TEG (PE19/97). Tolkien only gave explicit derivations for Q. <i>tie</i> “line” and <i>téma</i> row, but all the other derivatives appearing in the Etymologies for TEÑ “line” can be transferred to this new root.<br><br>Thus, between the 1930s and 1950s, Tolkien went from two roots (TEK and TEÑ) to three (TEK, TEÑ and TEG), with TEK (“write”) being essentially unchanged except that N. <i>teith</i> >> S. <i>taith</i>, with TEG adopting the meaning of TEÑ (“line”), and with TEÑ being assigned a new meaning (“indicate”).<br><br>Note that there is another later root TAN which means “indicate, show”, that is the basis for the names Q. <i>Tannacolli</i> and S. <i>Tengyl</i> “Signifier” (MR/385). It is an elaboration on the demonstrative root TA (PE18/84, 95) and has some conflicting derivatives: Q. <i>tanna</i> “sign, token” and Q. <i>tana-</i> “to show, indicate”. I am not sure whether this use of TAN should co-exist with TEÑ “indicate”.</div>

        <div class="content">Yes, I drew pretty much the same conclusions. Our focus was somewhat different. Alexsandr looked at the early period roots as well, whereas I wanted to know whether the derivatives of LEÑ from the Etymologies can be salvaged (they can). </div>
