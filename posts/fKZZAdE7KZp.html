        <div class="content">Wow, thank for the tips and corrections on the Quenya translations! I tried to get help making sure I didn't screw up terribly on Elfling, but didn't get much interest. I'm still learning/getting used to Quenya.<br><br>I definitely agree with you on IPA. I really prefer using it. But, at the same time, most people aren't familiar with it, so I wanted something that was intuitive but could still get most of the information across. This is something that is aimed at people who don't know the finer details of IPA... causal Tolkien language fans. Seeing as my page is in English, I figured that I might as well aim it more towards an English-speaking audience. If I ever get around to getting pages translated, then it'd be aimed for those languages' audiences, with different sounds highlighted.<br><br>Good point on Tenna-, I completely missed that!

        <div class="content">Almost forgot - alatulya the stress is on LA because the LY doesn't count as a double consonant in that it doesn't add any mora to the syllable before it, thus making it heavy. The pattern I've figured with Eldarin stress is that if the second to last syllable has more than one mora, then it receives stress instead of the 3rd from last syllable.<br><br>And amatúlie... that's just a mistake.

        <div class="content">I'll go from bottom up, because that's easier in this format.<br><br>+Xandarien Elanessa I'll have to include a link to the sound I guess. Same witht he French and German sounds too, I think.<br><br>+Lőrinczi Gábor Thank you! I've been trying to get critical eyes on this for a while, but no one has seemed interested.<br><br>I looked up the "Uin" thing, and yup, you are right. I don't know how I missed that. I'll have to go through and do a lot of editing to fix that blunder.<br><br>Ollo versus Oltho. Oltho is from Tolkien's Noldorin word lists, which means, if it needs to be normalized into Sindarin, it should be. In PE17, Tolkien explains the origins of intervocalic LL, one being LD, and the other being LT. In the case of LT, it became LTH, then LLH (long voiceless L) then LL in Central Sindarin. So, OLTAA becomes Olla- in Sindarin.<br><br>For the phrasebook proper I have a list of pronouns (I need to go through and add the reconstructed marks on them - I had them in red but forgot to change it when I went to a database) but for this short phrasebook that I made for others to put on their websites, yeah, I should mark the unattested pronouns too.<br><br>-l versus -dh for different dialects works on the principle that the Noldor borrowed into Sindarin their own 2nd person reverential pronoun. Tolkien explained this in PE17, page 26.<br><br>Gella- I didn't actually reconstruct this one, but I think it's solid. GYEL+TA.<br>For more information on NA words I use, you'll find them here: <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.realelvish.net/reconstructed_sindarin.php">http://www.realelvish.net/reconstructed_sindarin.php</a><br><br>We also have Lal- a borrowing from Quenya Lala-. In page 144 of PE17, it is attested as úlal - "not laughing/serious".<br><br>Galar... whoops. It should be Gelir. I'd prefer a word related to glîn, but I'll take what I can get.<br><br>"Ned i"  and "mi van" - I wrote about this on Elfling <a class="ext-link" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/36088">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/36088</a> and in my textbook <a class="ext-link" href="http://your-sindarin-textbook.realelvish.net/index.php?id=34">http://your-sindarin-textbook.realelvish.net/index.php?id=34</a> So, "Ned i" basically means "during which" and "mi van" means "in where".<br><br>"De" is mutated "ten" the oblique pronoun for the 3rd person singular. I have a hypothesis that the -n causes nasal mutation on the verb following it, thus often ends with it being deleted entirely. (this way, Le/De aren't exceptions to the way Sindarin pronouns are otherwise structured). You can see my early thoughts on this here: <a class="ext-link" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/35825">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/35825</a><br><br>"Achin" versus "angin" That's what I though for a while too, but when I read PE17, I found that Tolkien intended "an" to start out as "ANA". Initially causing vocalic mutation. Then the -A drops off, and the N starts to assimilate the place of articulation of the sounds following it. The beginning of Mixed Mutation, if you will. check out the ANA entry in PE17.<br><br>"Odulen" I took my cues here from <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~trenk/elvish/sindarin_past_tense.html">http://www.phy.duke.edu/~trenk/elvish/sindarin_past_tense.html</a> Even though they have different vowels in their ancient roots, (TUL vs NOR), I think that analogical leveling would occur in Sindarin, making for Odul and Onur, because they both have O's in them by the time Sindarin rolls around. Also, this little phrasebook is supposed to be for the Exilic Sindarin speakers, which is why throughout it I use lots of Quenya borrowings.<br><br>Nathla- is found in PE17 as well, page 141. the root mentioned is NATH.<br><br>Nîdh is found in VT 46 page 4, and it's mentioned in this article: <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~trenk/elvish/verbs.html">http://www.phy.duke.edu/~trenk/elvish/verbs.html</a><br><br>Abarad is an attempted reconstruction of "tomorrow". Like it?<br><br>Ar seems to be both "with/alongside" and "and", but you are right, a better translation is "follow me".<br><br>Anin/nad either could work. Nad does have the specific "to a place" meaning, so it might be better that way.<br><br>I used K in place of C in the pronunciation guide. I guessed that people would figure that out pretty quick. I might have to put in a not about Gs though.<br><br>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> Look at the syllable structure. a.ta.ri.nya a.la.tu.lya  In both cases, the second to last syllable doesn't have more than one mora. I follow Helge on the idea that LY and NY  are most often syllable onset sounds, thus counted as 1 consonant, rather than two.</div>

I might have to put in a not about Gs though.</strong><br><br>I mean, you left out "C" from the "Notes on the Pronunciation Guide", e.g. "(C) is always pronounced K", or something like that.<br><br><strong>Ollo versus Oltho. Oltho is from Tolkien's Noldorin word lists, which means, if it needs to be normalized into Sindarin, it should be. In PE17, Tolkien explains the origins of intervocalic LL, one being LD, and the other being LT. In the case of LT, it became LTH, then LLH (long voiceless L) then LL in Central Sindarin. So, OLTAA becomes Olla- in Sindarin.</strong><br><br>There is only one problem. The consonant group <i>lth</i> in <i>oltho</i> (< ÓLOS) comes from <i>ls</i>, not from <i>lt</i>. ;)<br><br><strong>-l versus -dh for different dialects works on the principle that the Noldor borrowed into Sindarin their own 2nd person reverential pronoun. Tolkien explained this in PE17, page 26.</strong><br><br>Well, according to PE/17:26, <i>de</i> was indeed replaced with <i>le</i>, but it is not mentioned that the Noldor ever borrowed <i>-l</i> as a personal verbal ending. As far as I know it is only attested as a possessive suffix, cf. <i>lammel</i> in PE/17:46.<br><br><strong>Gella- I didn't actually reconstruct this one, but I think it's solid. GYEL+TA.</strong><br><br>Mea culpa. I thought you just added a personal verbal ending to the noun <i>gell</i>. :)<br><br><strong>In page 144 of PE17, it is attested as úlal - "not laughing/serious".</strong><br><br>Fair point.<br><br><strong>So, "Ned i" basically means "during which" and "mi van" means "in where".</strong><br><br>You know, it's funny, <i>mi van</i> (as a question) means "what’s up?" in Hungarian. :P<br><br>Btw, what’s the problem with <i>ir</i>? :)<br><br><strong>"De" is mutated "ten" the oblique pronoun for the 3rd person singular.</strong><br><br>Are you referring to <i>ten</i> from Ae Adar nín? As far as I know it is supposed to mean "it", not "him" or "her". I think it would be an <i>eithad</i> if you used the pronoun "it" as a substitute for a person. :)<br><br><strong>"Achin" versus "angin" That's what I though for a while too, but when I read PE17, I found that Tolkien intended "an" to start out as "ANA".</strong><br><br>Oh yes, you are right. I always forget this stupid new mutation system of <i>an</i> and <i>na</i>. :)<br><br><strong>"Odulen" I took my cues here from </strong><a class="ext-link" href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~trenk/elvish/sindarin_past_tense.html">http://www.phy.duke.edu/~trenk/elvish/sindarin_past_tense.html</a><strong> Even though they have different vowels in their ancient roots, (TUL vs NOR), I think that analogical leveling would occur in Sindarin, making for Odul and Onur, because they both have O's in them by the time Sindarin rolls around. Also, this little phrasebook is supposed to be for the Exilic Sindarin speakers, which is why throughout it I use lots of Quenya borrowings.</strong><br><br>And tell me, how do you say "I came" in Quenya?  ;)<br><br><strong>Nathla- is found in PE17 as well, page 141. the root mentioned is NATH.</strong><br><br>Well, there is a word <i>nathlo</i>, but it is a question whether it's an infinitive form of a verb <i>*nathla-</i> or rather a noun.<br><br><strong>Nîdh is found in VT 46 page 4</strong><br><br>It's true, but is was rejected by Tolkien.<br><br><strong>Abarad is an attempted reconstruction of "tomorrow".</strong><br><br>So, I guess it is from <i>ab-</i> + <i>arad</i>.<br><br>I usually use <i>aur dolel</i> (or <i>*ordolel</i>), lit. "coming day" for "tomorrow".<br><br><strong>Nad does have the specific "to a place" meaning, so it might be better that way.</strong><br><br><i>nad</i>???</div>

        <div class="content">Moreover, it is very clear from Tolkien's analysis of Galadriel's Lament in <i>The Road Goes Ever On</i> (2nd ed., pp.66,76) that all the palatals are treated as double consonants medially. Thus the stress is on the penult in both  _hiruvAlye_  and <i>CalacIrya</i>.</div>

        <div class="content">Aha... you are right on the Quenya stress... Thanks for including a citation I could check out. Oh.... this is going to take so much editing...<br> <br>+Lőrinczi Gábor<br>First, how did you get the text to be bold like that? I'm still learning the ropes of Google+, and I don't know all of the tricks yet.<br> <br>"Notes on the Pronunciation Guide" are notes on the pronunciation guide, not on Tolkien's orthography choices. The pronunciation guide is designed to be the same for all of the languages. If people want to learn about the pronunciation themselves, they'd go to the pages describing the pronunciation in detail.<br> <br>OLOS - I don't know. In Sindarin there is ôl and evidence for an ancient OLO precursor, but I don't know if the S survived in the Telerin branch.<br> <br>On -dh vs -l... Exactly. The possessive suffixes eerily echo the verbal suffixes, and there is the use of lîn… making me think that they used L as the basis for the polite “you”, replacing entirely the D-root of Sindarin.<br> <br>‘I came’ in Quenya is “Tullen”, unless you were referring to the perfective, “utúlien”. I see your point. They’d still know that the root is TUL not TOL.<br> <br>Nathlo… well, it’s rather rare for Sindarin nouns to end up with a vowel at the end, isn’t it? And, there’s the much more typical of Sindarin “Nathal” also listed. And that it has the verb “to be kind to” listed directly after it… it seemed like a safe assumption to make.<br> <br>How do we know that Nîdh was rejected?<br> <br>Actually, for “coming day” I think Tolor/Tolarad might be better. Tolkien did note that I-verbs can be present participles (and nouns?) without any affixes added to them, and they can be put on the beginnings of words... but what you propose is certainly plausible too.<br> <br>Na(d), it’s in the same entry with ANA and “na” and “nan”. It says, “nat-, nad-, towards place. na-chaered.”<br> <br>Again, thank you so much for doing this. I’m having a lot of fun discussing Elven languages seriously with people, something that I end up starved for in RL. Also, you guys are being insanely helpful with your suggestions and pointing out little errors and things that I missed. It’s been too long since someone’s turned a critical eye to my translation work or my little Neo-Elvish hypotheses.</div>

        <div class="content">Oh, I forgot "ten". My thoughts on this is that Tolkien decided later on that in Sindarin the S-roots were used in demonstratives (thus Hain echant and Si - though Tolkien kept having second guesses on the later), which makes Ten a general 3rd person singular word. Aren't there also a few examples of "tîn" being used for persons too? (bess dîn is the example I can think of at the moment).<br><br>It's a pet hypothesis of mine.</div>
