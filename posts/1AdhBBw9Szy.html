        <div class="content">Question to Quenya phonologists! What does exactly happen to the initial CE consonant H in Quenya? Checking the sources, I found an almost 50/50 remaining/disappearing. In Helge's article it seems to be implied that they remain; however, at least twice in LVS, in <i>hanta</i> 'give (trans.)' from HAN and <i>hathaya > asea</i> 'athelas' from HATHA, the whole derivation <strong>depends</strong> on its syncope! Is it possible that <i>Eruhantale</i> is indeed from HAN then?</div>

This one is edited from γAN on the spot, when Tolkien notes that is would yield S. <i>ganed</i> instead of expected <i>aned</i>. We might suggest that here he was not yet considering the effects of such an introduction. Almost simultaneously he indeed devises γAN, but with (apparently) unconnected meaning 'adorn' to make Q. <i>antil</i> 'the middle finger', VT47:26 [oh, and this time the word-initial <i>h</i> does disappear. Why?]<br>Secondly, about a year later, he brings HAN back, this time 'add to, increase etc.' to derive <i>han</i> 'beyond' apparently the same as in <i>Átaremma</i> (it's quite unexpected to find this word in two places separated by more than a decade! — I wonder if he devised it as a preposition or a postposition?). As it seems, he keeps pondering over the things devised in the great update of 1969 and tries to get the etymologies straight. The addition 'esp. by gift' is very revealing: it shows he keeps the LVS 13 content as a base and extends the meaning to get to the word he remembered of the same apparent form.<br><i>Eruhantalë,</i> on the other hand, does emerge as early as the 'Description' and the 'Mariner's Wife', both apparently ca. late 1964 (per Christopher) — much earlier, hence there is always a possibility he devised it before ever thinking of HAN. It seems quite certain he didn't think of this word when making LVS 13 (otherwise he would never write γAN first!). If, however, we wish to fit it to the established stem (or believe Tolkien had HAN from <i>Átaremma</i> in mind for some years — <strong>without</strong> thinking about the possible connection to <i>anta</i> 'give'), we can notice that Tolkien does not say 'give' is <i>hanta;</i> quite the contrary, both the T. (and S.) cognates <i>hanin, aned</i> <strong>and</strong> the basic, verbal gloss of HAN — either in its 'give' or 'add to' incarnation! — which point to the basic, primary CE verb <i>han</i>. So, it is <i>han</i> which gets fused with <i>anta</i> — and a derivative <i>hanta</i> has any right to exist. However, it is unclear should we treat that as a causative derivation (would 'cause one to give or add' equal 'thank' or even 'magnify'?). Rather, I'd think about a half-strong pseudo-TALAT extension to alter or intensify ['honour by gift' > 'honour by thanking'] the meaning, as if from <i>han-at(a),</i> with past <i>hanante</i> and perfect <i>ahanantie</i> (<i>ahnátie?</i>). This could be a Quenya-only derivation (conscious) to get out of the undesired 'giving' connections. Then Q. E. D.: all seems to fit — and we have not a slightest idea of 'to thank' in Sindarin [Note 1].<br>To conclude, I must consider the alternate possibilities to derive <i>hanta</i> (though HAN with 'giving' is too good to be true [Note 2]). No stem of the form SKAN is known (to say nothing of HANAT, KHANAT or SKANAT). Still, we have an epic variety of KHAN (as noted in VT47, not necessarily <i>incompossible,</i> to quote Ambrose Bierce): 'brother' from the late 1960s (VT47-48), 'understand, comprehend' from <i>the Etymologies,</i> apparently transient 'back' from the PE17 (normally rendered by <i>nan</i> and connected forms or by <i>at</i>). γAN is not expected to be connected (unless Tolkien silently revised some of the phonology — and got everything back into place for LVS 13), but it does fit even less: it is consistently (PE17:155, PE17:158, VT47:27) connected with 'extension, length' and is an obvious base for the explanation of <i>anda</i> 'long' for which it is devised. γAN in <i>the Etymologies</i> is 'male person' and <i>annon</i> is rather from AD. Anyway, allative AN/NA is even a worse idea to explain <i>Eruhantale</i> [Note 3].<br><br>Note 1: Well, we have. Apparently: if 'to give' as just <i>aned</i> since summer 1969, is the cognate of <i>hanta,</i> the verb <i>annad,</i> free now, hm?<br><br>Note 2: In Russian, the ideas of 'thanking' and 'giving' are strongly connected, with the most common verb 'to thank', благодарить, easily decomposed into 'well'-'to present, make a gift'. Apparently, the overall Germanic idea of connecting 'thank' and 'thought' did not influence Tolkien — but the form of the word 'Thanks-<i>giving</i>' could.<br><br>Note 3: And much less improbable for it to be a totally unmentioned stem — they are already overcrowded! — if it is, SKANAT/SKAN-AT is the only possibility making sense to me.<br><br>*And in Leeds-Quenya, <i>hanta</i> is a 'blow with an axe' (see PE13:147). Speak about thanking…<br><br>(Valar, I never expected to write all of that…)﻿</div>
