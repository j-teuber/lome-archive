        <div class="content">I've released version 0.7.0 of Eldamo:<br><br><a class="ext-link" href="https://eldamo.org/">https://eldamo.org/</a><br><br>In this release, I've finished up my work on incorporating neologisms into Eldamo for the time being. I will still capture and add individual neologisms as I see them.<br><br>I fixed the issue where neologisms would appear when searching and browsing in "Academic Mode". Unfortunately there was a bug in the search that I didn't notice until after I finished the build, so I fixed on the site but it isn't fixed in the downloadable copy. It will be fixed everywhere in the next release.<br><br>I also took a stab at doing Semantic Mappings for Quenya and it was ... exhausting. I finished a first pass, but it needs review. However, I am too sick of it to continue on it right now, much less tackle Sindarn. I will do more later.<br><br>Next up, I intend to do a deep dive on Sindarin phonetics, hopefully putting it into something resembling a finished state.<br><br>Furthermore, now that G+ is dying, I need to change how I publicize Eldamo releases. In particular, I intend to cross post in several places:<br><br>1) <a class="ext-link" href="https://academy.realelvish.net/">https://academy.realelvish.net/</a><br>2) <a class="ext-link" href="http://middangeard.org.uk/aglardh/">http://middangeard.org.uk/aglardh/</a><br>3) The Vinye Langengolmor Discord Group<br><br>Real Elvish and Aglardh both have RSS feeds you can use to monitor their news:<br><br><a class="ext-link" href="http://middangeard.org.uk/aglardh/rss.xml">http://middangeard.org.uk/aglardh/rss.xml</a><br><a class="ext-link" href="https://academy.realelvish.net/feed/">https://academy.realelvish.net/feed/</a><br><br>In addition, the release notices in Github also have an Atom feed (basically RSS):<br><br><a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/pfstrack/eldamo/releases.atom">https://github.com/pfstrack/eldamo/releases.atom</a><br><br>The last of these is the most "reliable" in the sense that I intend to remain on Github indefinitely. However, I chose the other sites for their activity and longevity, and intend to stay on them for as long as they are around. I will also keep posting in G+ until it is shut down.</div>
