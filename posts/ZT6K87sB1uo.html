I don't know where you're based, but both Fiona and I are based in the US.  As I understand it, Americans enjoy much stronger fair use protections than people in European countries, which the Estate discovered the hard way.  Here is an overview of the American fair use doctrine: <a class="ext-link" href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/">http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/</a><br>And here is the actual doctrine:<br><a class="ext-link" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107</a><br><br>So, even re-writing the Lord of the Rings (on the really rather stupid premise that Tolkien didn't understand Westron when he was translating the Red Book, so there were actually 3 Nazgul, or something) and publishing it commercially is fair use.  (This actually happened.  I don't feel like sorting through filth to find an article about it, but Googling "Tolkien A New Translation" might get you somewhere.) <br><br>Fiona's project is educational/academic.  The Estate most likely doesn't even have copyright over the language, see: <a class="ext-link" href="http://conlang.org/axanar/">http://conlang.org/axanar/</a>.  And if anything, Fiona's textbook will drive sales Tolkien's work.  If the Estate was stupid enough to bring a lawsuit, I can't see it surviving a motion to dismiss.</div>
