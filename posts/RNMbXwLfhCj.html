        <div class="content">I've released v.0.6.8 of Eldamo:<br><br><a class="ext-link" href="https://eldamo.org/">https://eldamo.org/</a><br><br>With this release, I have finished a "first pass" at evaluating attested primitive roots for inclusion/exclusion in my dialect of Neo-Eldarin. I produced a whole bunch of neologisms in the process. This was mainly an exercise in figuring out my style of neologism creation and getting comfortable with the process, although as with most thing in Tolkien linguistics, it took much, much longer than I anticipated.<br><br>As I mentioned in my last post, now that I am comfortable with the scope of my own neologism creation, I am ready to incorporate neologisms from other people into Eldamo. I've decided to be very inclusive, and add neologisms to Eldamo even I myself wouldn't use them, provided they are of a reasonable quality. In fact, I've already included a few such words.<br><br>If you have a neologisms you want me to add to Eldamo, let me know. The bar is not very high. You only need to convince that the would could <i>conceivably</i> be part of Neo-Eldarin; you don't have to convince me that its a word that I myself should use. In other words, it should fit the phonetic structure of the given language (Quenya or Sindarin) and should be justified in some way by existing forms (or be a good loan word from a real-world language), but otherwise more or less anything is fair game.<br><br>At some point in the future I may pare the list down to "accepted" and "rejected" neologisms, and I still have some vague hopes for some community-driven process for evaluating neologisms. I also reserve the right to offer alternatives and open things up to community debate. Sometimes (though not always) such discussions can result in some kind of general consensus on the "right" word, and when they do I find the resulting neologism tends to be of higher quality.<br><br>The best way to offer up proposed neologisms is here on the Discord server. You don't need to specifically mention me; I intend to keep an eye on future neologism discussions and add interesting neologisms to Eldamo once any "debate" has settled down.</div>

        <div class="content">After posting the above, I’m a bit worried that some of the things I said might give the wrong impression. When I said “I will include neologisms that I would not use myself”, I’m afraid people might think that what I meant was “I will include your neologisms even if I think they’re garbage”.<br><br>What I really meant was this:<br><br>There are a large variety of possible “styles” of creating neologisms. Most of the neologisms in Eldamo right now fit my style, because they were mostly created by me. But my style is not the only way to go about creating neologisms, and is not necessarily better than the style and approach others might take.<br><br>What I want to do is include “good” neologisms that are created using a different style or set of priorities than my own. While I have my own preferences, other approaches are equally legitimate. If someone makes a neologism of a different “style” than my own, I’d still like to add such neologisms to Eldamo.<br><br>My hope is, at some point in future, that we will be able to establish some sort of community rating system for neologisms so that we reach some consensus on vocabulary. Until then, I think it’s better to include a larger variety of neologisms in various styles, so that individuals can choose among them. </div>

        <div class="content">I suppose the answer is negative (and maybe I'm not the first one to ask this), but still: Is there a way to display Eldamo <i>without</i> the neologisms?<br>(I would definitely appreciate that - the neologisms are getting numerous and filtering them out in one's mind only is getting more and more difficult while working with the database...)</div>
