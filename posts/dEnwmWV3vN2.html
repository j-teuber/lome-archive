        <div class="content">Concernig giving and thanking (and approaching). <br><br>For some time when I think of Eruhantale “thanksgiving”, and similarity of Elvish words expressing “giving” and “thanking”, I remind myself of the polish translation of Torah by Rabbi Sacha Pecaric. <br>He had chosen to translate the Hebrew word <korban> as "giving" [Polish "oddanie" meaning "giving back, returning" but also "devotion"] which is "getting closer" instead of "sacrifice" which is "offered". And that’s  how he explains such a solution: "The word <korban> has the stem <karav> that most precisely can be translated as "get closer", "approach". [...] In verbal aspect of the word <korban> I deemed most appropriate "approximation", and in substantial aspect "giving". "Giving" [...]is a return to God his property. [...] "Giving" expresses the feelings of commitment, zeal,  submission. [...] «Sacrifice» means a donation or even a contribution [...] These connotations are [...] distant from the meaning of the word <korban> [...] [and] the idea associated with <korbanot> i.e. givings: [...] that something is being returned to God, and [...] that it is a spiritual closeness - the two aspects [...]are present in the word "giving "".<br><br>That seems to me surprisingly analogical to NA/ANA, HAN, and all the: an, na, anta-, antha-, anna, -nna, hantale. What do you think?<br>﻿</div>

        <div class="content">That there is a semantic link in Q(u)enya between the act of thanking and giving, and that a similar link exists in Hebrew, makes sense. (Although the link is not universal; English <i>thank</i> is linked to <i>think</i>, and in Hungarian <i>köszön</i> has the meaning "thank" and "greet".<br><br>What's rather interesting to me that this rather common and important verb is so scarcely attested in the Elvish corpus; as far as I know even the usually so helpful and rich Gnomish corpus does not contain anything like it; all we have is <i>Eruhantale</i> and the root HAN as glossed in VT43. We don't even know whether Tolkien had <i>*hantale</i> in mind when he glossed HAN (although it is certainly possible).</div>

        <div class="content">I've got a crazy idea: is it possible that there is only one verb <i>anta-</i> meaning both 'give' and 'thank', and <strong>h</strong> in <i>eruhantale</i> is only intrusive consonant put there to avoid hiatus?﻿</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#remi-korben">Remi Korben</a> He wrote <i>Eruontari</i> 'Mother of God_ around the same period (second half of 50s), so — no. The thing is, Tolkien changed his mind about the initial H of Eldarin. When he introduced that basic element in a revision to <i>Outline of Phonology</i> he made it remain in Q and vanish in all Telerin; however, in QE it already remains consistently both in Q and T. There is little doubt that when writing <i>Eruhantale</i> in ca. 1959 (and maybe even when retyping it in 1965) he had no problems with its derivation from HAN and sufficient difference from <i>anta</i> which was consistently from AN 'allative' since the Etym., except maybe the obvious semantic parallel. The waters have muddled when Tolkien started seriously considering around 1968 (and often assuming as a fact) that H remains <i>in Telerin only</i>. See HENET, <i>hor</i> etc. in <i>Notes on Óre</i> discussion, PE22 and similar. (However, he did not make a conscious shift! In LVS13 he reminds himself that H in Quenya does remain [to disobey himself in the next phrase]. He just wanted more sources for Q vocalic beginning — and got them. A parallel problem was that he noticed: _anta_could only mean something like 'send' if treated lightly; so in mid-60s he reshapes it from AM (Comparative in Eldarin), and in 1969 apparently forgets that.<br>Actually, I keep believing in H remaining (too many things crumble without that) and hence in <i>hanta</i> 'thank' separate from <i>anta</i> < amta 'give'. Sindarin might be <i>antha, anthant</i> for former and <i>antha, aun</i> for latter; or even <i>antha, anthant</i> vs. <i>an, aun</i> which I favour. After all, in the batch of <i>Comparative, and, Ambar</i> Tolkien allows himself many minor abandoned controversies in commentary, such as suddenly making <i>men</i> 'go, proceed' into <i>menta</i> for no reason and eliminating any word for 'send' by wiping <i>anta</i> simultaneously. Hence — I do take his <i>anha</i> there lightly, as a remnant of a previous concept.</div>
