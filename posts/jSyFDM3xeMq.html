But how about medial NG followed by a consonant?<br><br>It seems that some Elvish students or linguists believe NG followed by a consonant should be pronounced as [ŋ] not [ŋg] just like final ng as in Glaurung: Angband[ɑŋbɑnd], Angmar[ɑŋmɑr], Angrod [ɑŋrod], Anglachel[ɑŋlɑxel].<br><br>It may feel more natural with just [ŋ] sound to most English speakers but according to Tolkien's note in Appendix E, I think it is more likely with distinct g sound as in Grond: Angband[ɑŋgbɑnd], Angmar[ɑŋgmɑr], Angrod [ɑŋgrod], Anglachel[ɑŋglɑxel]<br><br>Is there any evidence to overthrow Tolkien's direction in Appendix E?</div>

        <div class="content">That is an excellent question. In Tolkien's <i>Outline of Phonology</i> (PE19/68-107), Tolkien describes the development of nasals combined with voiced stops, stating that "mb, nd, ñg were among the the most favoured consonant groups in Quenya" and "mb, nd, ñg suffered no further change in 'correct' TQ [Tarquesta = Spoken Quenya]" (PE19/92).<br><br>That argues strongly for medial [ŋg].</div>

        <div class="content">If we think about how compounds are formed, almost all "medial NG"s are originally followed by a vowel: aŋga-runja >>> angruin.

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ekin-gören">Ekin Gören</a> Actually, David Salo is of the opinion that final [-ŋg] became [-ŋ] in Sindarin, and I trust his judgement over mine. See <i>Gateway to Sindarin</i> p. 64, rule §4.202. The Sindarin phonetic analysis in Eldamo is very, very incomplete.<br><br>Salo does seem to be of the opinion that medial [ŋg] either remained or was restored in the phonetic development of Sindarin.

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> I meant <i>attested</i> rule, as in PE19. But "... except finally where it was sounded as in English sing" could be Salo's basis for §4.202. Looking at [ŋ]'s sisters, we have (both monosyllabic) "-m(b>ø)" and "-nd", though this only adds to the confusion. I should revisit PE19.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ekin-gören">Ekin Gören</a> Actually I find PE22 a better source for Noldorin/Sindarin phonetic information, and I did find some direct quotes from Tolkien on the development of [ŋg]:<br><br>"The groups mb, nd, ŋg written [as tengwar malta, númen, noldo] have now become [m]; [nn] medially and [n] finally; [ŋg] medially and [ŋ] finally" (PE22/35)<br><br>And<br><br>"In late Exhilic [ŋg] suffered no further change. [tengwa noldo] thus represents [ŋg] except finally, where it is [ŋ]. [ŋg] has since remained before r, l, but became [ŋ] before other consonants, as Angband = [aŋban]. Before a main stress [ŋg] is sometimes in Toleressean reduce to [ŋ], but this is not normal." (PE22/36)<br><br>So, this would indicate pronunciations:<br><br>Angband [ɑŋbɑn] and Angmar [ɑŋmɑr]<br><br>but Angrod [ɑŋgrod], Anglachel [ɑŋglɑxel]<br><br>Of course, the above is Tolkien writing about Noldorin in the 1930s, and he could have changed his mind about Sindarin.</div>
