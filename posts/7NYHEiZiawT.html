        <div class="content">PE17:131: in non-Northern dialects of Sindarin and late Beleriandic speech, medial <strong>lt</strong>, <strong>mp</strong>, <strong>nt</strong>, <strong>nc</strong> 'became long voiceless <strong>lh</strong>, <strong>mh</strong>, <strong>nh</strong>, <strong>ñh</strong>', and finally 'became voiced <strong>ll</strong>, <strong>mm</strong>, <strong>nn</strong>, <strong>ng</strong> <i>unless followed still by a stressed syllable</i>'.<br>VT42:27: 'Medially however <strong>nth</strong>, <strong>nch</strong>, <strong>mf</strong>, and <strong>lth</strong> became long voiceless n, ñ, m, l, though the old spelling was mostly retained (beside nh, ñh, mh, lh), and among those to whom Sindarin became a language of lore, as the men of Gondor who were or claimed to be of Númenórean race, <i>the spirant was reintroduced from the spelling</i>'; 'In the transcription of Elvish Sindarin in The Lord of the Rings <strong>ll</strong> is used in the manner of modern Welsh <i>for the medial voiceless l</i>; as in mallorn < malhorn < malþorn < malt ‘gold’ and orn ‘tree’'.<br>How are these ideas supposed to be reconciled? Considering <strong>lt</strong>, for Tolkien himself provided and example: we learn that (a) in the branch of Sindarin which survived the First Age, such a medial cluster was rendered long and voiceless <strong>lh</strong>, though the orthography did not represent it and remained <strong>lth</strong>, <i>which in Gondorian and similar non-native speech was rendered back into [lþ] from the spelling</i>; hence, no matter how spelled in Latin letters, with <i>lth</i> (oltha-), <i>ll</i> (mallorn) or <i>lh</i>, it is supposed to be read long and voiceless if we are to pronounce the way the Elves themselves did, but as a combination liquid + spirant to represent Mannish use: <i>dolthannen</i> is [do`ɬ:an̥:en] in actual Elvish use — but [dol`þanþen] or, possibly, [dol`þan:en] if we are to suggest that Latin spelling somehow represents the orthographical traditions already established in Fëanorian tengwar.<br>It's nice and clear, but enter (b): these long and voiceless clusters are <strong>voiced again</strong> <i>unless followed still by a stressed syllable</i>, and that happens <i>specifically in Elvish post-War of Wrath usage</i>. Now, <i>mallorn</i> is supposed to be just [`mal:orn] and nothing else, for the vowel is unstressed; then <strong>which use does Tolkien mean when saying 'In the transcription of Elvish Sindarin in The Lord of the Rings </strong><i><strong>ll</strong></i><strong> is used in the manner of modern Welsh </strong><i><strong>for the medial voiceless l</strong></i><strong>'</strong>, if the Elves read it with <strong>ll</strong> and Men with <strong>lth</strong> (or <strong>ll</strong> as well, if the spelling changed)?﻿</div>

        <div class="content">I don't think there is a definitive way of reconciling these, but here is my current theory. <br><br>I believe that voiceless medial nasals probably voiced sooner than medial <i>lh</i>, probably aided by the voicing of initial voiceless nasals that develop (for example) from <i>sn-</i>, <i>sm-</i>, while the voiceless medial <i>lh</i> lingered longer, aided by the retention of initial voiceless <i>lh-</i>.<br><br>Because they voiced earlier, the spelling for the resulting double nasals was more likely to be changed, and thus they were less likely to be reformed back to <i>nth</i>, <i>mph</i>, whereas the spelling for voiceless <i>lh</i> was retained longer making their reformation to <i>lth</i> more likely. <br><br>It may be that in those rarer cases where the spelling of <i>lh</i> became "ll", then the combination was usually fully voiced, but where the original "lth" spelling was retained, it was pronounced as a voiceless <i>lh</i> among the Elves, and reformed back to <i>lth</i> among Men. I think <i>mallorn</i> falls into the category, and was so spelled by Tolkien because the word was usually spoke by Elves in the Lord of the Rings. <br><br>Conversely, <i>anna-</i> "to give" was so pronounced by both Elves and Men. </div>
