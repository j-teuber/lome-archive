        <div class="content">One could think that adapting Quenya for modern age is difficult because of science and technology. Yet it seems that the "weak link" is in the commonest everyday vocabulary, even after PE17 and PE22 expansion. What shall we do with "towel" and "toothpaste", "sugar" and "pepper", "rice" and "cabbage", "kitten" and "hamster", "turning the lights on" and "frying", and "coming for a visit" and so on? I began to collect words for a kind of "My first dictionary" for kids and found all these gaps üò• , and even Helge's Bible and Paul's database doesn't help.</div>

        <div class="content">You've hit the nail on the head. The biggest hurdle for using Quenya and Sindarin as anything remotely resembling a real language is the severe lack of vocabulary. We have only a few thousands words, while most real-world speakers have vocabularies of 100,000 or more.<br><br>Unfortunately, there isn't a clear way to add new vocabulary to the language either. We can invent neologisms using existing roots, but that's only going to get us so far. At some point we are going to need to coin entirely new words off of brand new roots, but I've never heard anyone suggest a good approach for doing that.</div>

        <div class="content">Oh lovely, sugar = "sweet dust", I'd forgotten all about that. G. <i>glist</i> and <i>glissith</i> both still fit Sindarin phonology, and the root LIS still survives in Tolkien's latter writing.<br><br>The second element "dust" = G thith, whose root SISI (actually √ûI√ûI) did not survive, but I think the closest latter analog is N/S. <i>list</i> "ash, sand" < LITH.

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> I would prioritize "modernized early forms" over new derivations from late roots. This is for two reasons: (1) I prefer to use forms that Tolkien used at some point over inventing my own and (2) I find that new derivations from late roots often pay "fast and loose" with the meanings of those roots, especially since such primitive formations were among the least stable elements of Tolkien's languages.<br><br>The only caveat is that it must be possible to justify the modernized early form within the phonetic and etymological system of Tolkien's later languages, otherwise it can't be used. In other words, when "creating new derivations from attested roots", I think you should first look for early forms that can be adapted into the later system before inventing entirely new ones.<br><br>Taken this way, many of these early adaptations would probably also qualify as "derivations from attested roots", except that they are based on words Tolkien actually used at some point rather than invented out of thin air.<br><br>This is, however, a personal preference. I know others prefer to avoid early forms if at all possible.</div>

You could then assign individual users a ‚Äúweight‚Äù based on their level of skill or amount of participation.<br><br>Then rating = total (up votes * weights) / (all votes * weights).<br><br>For words already in the corpus, they could be pre-assigned a certain number of up votes and down votes.

        <div class="content">Sabbath is over, I am back here. All the ideas you exposed above, are great. I like the concept of hierarchy of methods very much; and indeed, much the same as Paul, I'd give more weight to the early material. It is better to adapt the attested forms, especially taking into attention that we have enough precedents when a root or a word from 1920s pops up in the drafts from 1960s.<br>I don't know how the rating system can be technically implemented, but the idea is attractive, too.</div>
