It should be v>w /V_#<br><br>In Sindarin, /v/ became a /w/ when it is found between a Vowel and the end of a word. (The underscore stands for the letter I was talking about, and the pound sign stands for the end of a word. The V is shorthand for "any Vowel".)<br><br>Evidence: (I'll use Sindarin/Noldorin VS Quenya because that's easy)<br>Q. lómë - S. dû (-w deleted in presence of /u/)<br>Q. lúmë - S. lû<br>Q. tuima - N. tuiw<br>Q. hráva - S. rhaw (see also: rhavan)<br>Q. caima - N. caew<br>Q. laive - N. glaew<br>Q. haime - N. haew<br>Q. himya- - N. hîw<br>Q. yáve - N. iaw<br>Q. quáme - N. paw<br>Q. ráva - N. raw<br>Q. roime - N. ruiw<br><br>Tolkien, even in the Noldorin phrase, was considering this idea, but applied it inconsistently - or so it seems.

        <div class="content">Turned into /w/ after high vowels... interesting idea! Not just high vowels though, perhaps only high long vowels/diphthongs? This change would have to come before AI and OI became AE and OE, but after /o/>/au/ and /e:/>/i:/.<br>What about Fladrif? Why does this /v/ stay around?<br>Could the name have been formed before this change, leaving the /v/ behind a short /i/?<br>Or perhaps the missing element is Stress, not the number of morae the syllable takes. That may actually be simpler. But what about Orome-Araw?<br><br>This stream of conscious linguistic babble brought to you by 8 AM and a looming interview. I hope it's not too unintelligible.</div>

        <div class="content">For vowel mutations, see the article by Bertrand Bellet:<br><a class="ext-link" href="http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/vowel_affection_sindarin_noldorin">http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/vowel_affection_sindarin_noldorin</a><br><br>But back to the topic: Already in the Etymologies we find N. nîf < nībe (NIB-) and N. rhîf corresponding to Q. ríma (RĪ-). In later Sindarin, there is also îf 'cliff' < īb- (PE17:92) (rhîw is an uncertain case, I find to primitive form given), so it would appear that N. hîw < khīmā is the oddball here.<br><br>After diphthongs we have N. hnuif < *sneumi (SNEW-) with preserved /v/ in contrast to rhui(w) < *roime (ROY1-), tuiw < tuimā (TUY-) and others.<br>For later Sindarin both patterns are attested as well, see S. oew < okma (PE17:170) and S. lhoew, Q. hloima (PE17:185), but S. raef, Q. raima (VT42:12).<br><br>From an external perspective it seems that this is one of those sound shifts Tolkien didn't have a fixed, immutable conception of. From an internal perspective one could explain the variations by dialect loans.<br><br>In Araw, we have /auv/ > /aw/ both according to WJ:400, as well as PE17:153 - this development does seem to be a fixed conception, so it's unproblematic.<br><br>But it's a good thing that you brought this up, since I've realized that N. rhîf was regularised to S. *rîw in our wordlists which seems completely unjustified.</div>
