        <div class="content">I wonder why most people tend to just care about "late" and "LotR-compatible" material, and despise anything "early" concerning both languages and legendarium. Seriously? This annoys me.<br><br>Thankfully there are a few people who, like me, really care about Tolkien's "early" languages and legendarium. The most notable example of whom I know is Roman Rausch, webmaster of Sindanórië.<br><br>And finally here's my opinion on the legendarium: I prefer the early versions since they happen in our own world, so one can really feel that might have happened. Moreover I also prefer to believe that Quenya and Noldorin were distinct languages (with Beleriandic being yet another one) rather than that the Noldor spoke Quenya and adopted Sindarin.</div>

        <div class="content">'Despise' is a strong word.<br>I cannot speak for others, of course. As for my viewpoint on 'early' material: I love them, admire, them, read them, have them available in VTs and PEs. I just have not yet managed to gather the time and energy to learn them to a level on which I could use them comfortably. But I will, one they, because it's intriguing to have the big vocabularies of Goldogrin and Qenya at fingertips!<br>What I'm not comfortable is mixing e.g. very early Qenya forms with later material. To me that feels as if I started mixing Old English words into my speech.</div>

        <div class="content">I think, early materials can indeed provide us with vocabulary items missing in the later sources, but only under some conditions:<br>1) they must be phoneticly consistent with LotR-style phonology;<br>2) they shouldn't override the roots attested later;<br>3) they need to be adapted grammatically (if needed).</div>

        <div class="content">Yes, but what I mean is that early materials should be given a little more love. Like using/appreciating the earlier versions/conceptions of the languages instead of only caring about the LotR canon.</div>

        <div class="content">Olga, I understand your feelings, but the very structures of languages of early documents like "Qenya Lexicon" and the one of the LotR are too much different. People needed to make a choice for the standard. Later texts make more sense. That's all. No despice. Mere common sense.<br>You may wonder how much of the early material<br>1) is indeed incorporated into Neo-Quenya compositions nowadays;<br>2) shows stability during the years and decades, and even triconsonantal verb roots pop up as late as in PE17 publications (that's ca. 1960s, I think).</div>
