Indeed, if we do believe that there is a complete paradigm of dative personal pronouns behind the screen, there are multiple mechanisms to yield the attested two, <i>enni</i> and <i>ammen</i>. From this scarce evidence we can surely deduce that this mechanism is a) not lenition (we'd have **<i>aven/anven</i>) and b) not sundóma reduplication (we'd have **<i>inni</i>, <i>emmen</i>). But there are three patterns (well, four…) which may be of consequence:<br><br>1) <i>an-</i>-prefixation with nasal mutation, which equals a-prefixation with a dynamic lengthening of the first consonant (with a possible i-affection performed later).<br><br>2) Compounding: <i>an</i> joins the word as if it were a first stem of a compound.<br><br>3) Evolution: <i>an</i> appends to the word at a (possibly, supposed) Old Sindarin stage and evolves as a single word.<br><br>The problem is: these methods all give the attested forms, but heavily diverge when reconstructing new. Assuming *<i>te</i>, I listed the final results in a table (I consciously exclude the unsettling <i>le</i>, used in dative function widely, as a borrowed one):<br><br>Nom Acc Pref.   Comp. Development<br>ni      nin   annin annin   annin<br>ci      cen achen angen angen<br>de     den annen anden annen<br>so     son asson anhon asson<br>se     sen assen anhen assen<br>sa     san assan anhan assan<br>te      ten athen anden annen<br><br>mí men ammen ammen ammen<br>ci   cen   achen   angen    angen<br>di   den   annen   anden    annen<br>sy   syn   essyn   enhyn    essyn<br>si    sin    essin     enhin     essin<br>sai sain essain   enhain   essain<br>ti     tin    ethin     endin     ennin<br><br>In the known reconstructions, Thorsten Renk obviously prefers the 'prefixation' pattern, though introduces unnecessary reflexive forms and misses <i>te</i>, and +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#fiona-jallings">Fiona Jallings</a>, on the contrary, bases her paradigm on 'compounding' structure, though goes even further, undoing the i-affection and making 2nd person familiar pronoun out of an unexpected nominative form.<br><br>As you can observe, sometimes all three variant forms are pairwise inconsistent. Personally, I believe that pattern 1 is our best guess, for I'm unaware of any prefixal element (which <i>an</i> obviously is) behaving as a full-fleshed stem and making compounds 2; on the contrary, employing mutations with respective shifts of its own final consonants 1 is a well-attested and normal behaviour. Furthermore, it would be strange to assume these forms as an early development (Q. and T. cognates of <i>Gúren bed enni</i> disprove that, showing the very same early pattern <i>nín</i>, which is different from Sindarin), hence only a tiny possibility of 3. I'd take scheme 1 for our own translations (which I indeed applied for compositions of mine), what do you fellow Lambengolmor think about that?﻿</div>

        <div class="content">I believe pronouns are the oldest words of every language and we can observe that they change during ages not as much as other words do. So are the 3 sentences 'my heart tells me' a prove that there wasn't any ancestor of enni in Common Eldarin? I support the 1st pattern but also Thorsten Renk's theory that Sindarin pronouns which are attested may have evolved from the 'long consonant' stems: <i>nya, cca, mma, lla</i> thats why they result in: <i>in, ech</i> (not <i>eg</i>), <i>em</i> (not <i>ef</i>), and <i>el</i> (?). The ones used by David Salo in the movies: <i>eg</i> and <i>edh</i> may have come from <i>ca, lda</i>. And i suppose that difference is visible in dative too.﻿</div>

        <div class="content">I have used "enni" and "annin" both, in my time, but now I use "annin". I think that with the phrase "Guren bêd enni", there's several odd things going that have an elegant solution, one that made me change my mind.<br><br>Don't think of it like a normal phrase, with normal grammatical rules. Think of it as a cliche, something repeated so often that it has become worn down into a memorized segment. There are several things that point to this: mutation of "pêd"; vowel shortening of "gúren" to "guren"; and last, I-affection and clipping to "annin". <br><br>This isn't the only phrase Tolkien made like this. There's also "Mae govannen." Looking at what he wrote about trying to justify this phrase in this form, he ended up with "mae ci govannen" getting shortened to "mae c'ovannen" which got shortened to "mae govannen". Basically, he was making something akin to "Howdy!" which comes from the old greeting, "How do you do?"<br><br>Therefore, I think that "To/for me" is "annin".</div>

        <div class="content">I actually have some explanations for the dative case for Sindarin pronouns, one that I've posted about on Elfling before, and I include it in my lessons. My post on Elfling went unnoticed though. Anyways, I think that this explanation is more elegant, because there aren't exceptions.<br><br>First off, I think that there is a difference between transitive and intransitive verbs. With a transitive verb, when there is a <strong>dative pronoun</strong>, it is without fail marked with "an". "caro ammen" (do for us) "ai gerir úgerth ammen" (who do sins to us) "guren bêd enni" (my heart says to me) "Naur dan i ngaurhoth ammen" (Fire against the wolf-pack for us). (Note that with regular nouns, it looks like "an" can be dropped, as long as the second noun is the dative one, and the verb is di-transitive) But, if it is an intransitive verb, like in "le nallon" (I cry out to you) or "le linnathon" (I will sing to you), "an" can be dropped, and the pronoun will go in the same place that the pronoun-object of the verb would go, as seen in "hain echant" (made those).<br><br>We see this -n show up in Sindarin pronouns. I'm not counting possessive pronouns, but I mean "Tiro nin" (watch over me) "ammen" (for/to us) "caro den" (do it) "hain echant" (made those). Comparing Sindarin to Quenya, in Quenya, the -n is dative, but in Sindarin, looking at these examples, it clearly isn't. Instead, I think that this is like the English Oblique case. But, if it is why is there sometimes no -n?<br><br>Looking at times that the proposed oblique -n isn't there, there's a commonality.  "le nallon" (I cry out to you) or "le linnathon" (I will sing to you). Think of Nasal mutation. If the phrases were originally "len nallon" "len linnation" and "hain echant", nasal mutation would delete the -n on len because "linnation" begins with an L and "nallon" begins with an N, but because "echant" begins with a vowel, the -n on "hain" is left untouched.<br><br>There is one exception, "gohenam <strong>di</strong> ai gerir úgerth ammen" (We forgive they who do sins to us), but I think I know why we'd see a mutated nominative pronoun here. It has a relative clause attached, and in that clause, "they" is the subject. So, it's the nominative pronoun, with mutation on it like it's a regular accusative noun because it heads the phrase that is the direct object.<br><br>What makes this explanation elegant is that with it, there are no exceptions to the rule. All of the forms aren't just accounted for, they are generated with this system.<br><br>So, for clarification, the system I'm proposing is like this:<br><br><strong>Nominative</strong>: No additions to the pronoun root.<br><strong>Oblique</strong>: add -n to the end of the pronoun, and use the appropriate mutation.<br><strong>Dative</strong>: prefix "an" to an oblique pronoun.<br><strong>Possessive</strong>: Retaining only the initial consonant, delete the vowel of the pronoun and replace it with "-în".</div>

        <div class="content">BTW, In PE17 the mutation that "an" uses was called "vocalic", but not quite... Tolkien cited the N>M in "ammen". I think that it's actually using a long-mixed mutation, not a nasal mutation, as was proposed so long ago. Therefore, the dative pronouns would be:<br><br>annin, ammen, *angwen, *angin, *anlen, *anden, *anden, *andin, *anhan, *anhain, *anhen, *anhin, anim, *anech, *anest.

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#matt-dinse">Matt Dinse</a><br>Off topic:<br>I'd gladly switch Sindarin 'these four variants are wrong, now deduce the right' to Quenya 'one of these four variants is true, but they are contradictory'! One thing that brings me joy every day is that I ventured into Tolkienian linguistics early; I actually plan to be around when final VT and PE are out. In fact, maybe all of us should postpone any pronoun musings till after PE23 is in print, which by all means should include the long-awaited 'Common Eldarin Pronouns, Demonstratives and Correlatives'?..<br><br>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#fiona-jallings">Fiona Jallings</a><br>On topic:<br>To discover the pattern, we need two pieces of information: (1) what does Tolkien mean under 'vocalic': lenition, nasal mutation or intervocalic assimilation and (2) which consonants are affecting the final -n. But I don't believe any Sindarin pattern could lead to such an <i>uncouth</i> (equë Tolkien) combination as <i>nl</i> [attested in Sindarin only in a loose-compound <i>minlammad</i> — in any Gnomish/Noldorin/Sindarin stage!] I believe, his words about <i>ana</i> (they are final, for the quotation after that is 'crossed out', per PE17 editors) suggest the scheme:<br>1. <i>Ana-</i> is prefixed and causes lenition.<br>2. Middle <i>a</i> is syncopated.<br>3. <i>If the remaining cluster is counter-Sindarin, it is assimilated, and it is presumably </i><i><strong>n</strong></i><i> of the prefix which assimilates</i>.<br><br>Thus we get:<br> <i>annin</i>, <i>angen</i>, <i>allen</i> (nl > ll), <i>andhen</i> (?! — also a never happening combination, could turn <i>annen</i> more probably), <i>anhon/anhen/anhan</i> and finally <i>anden</i> (plus the plurals).<br><br>Indeed the old schemes are Noldorin, but Tolkien was unlucky while pulling Noldorin <i>hain</i> into Moria gate inscription; now we have to accomodate it. The gloss is quite suggestive of <i>sa/te</i> distribution following the lines of 'close/far', 'definite/general' and/or 'mentioned before/impersonal'. But the comparison to Quenya leads to another important distinction: <i>-se</i> and <i>-sa</i> can <i>distinguish animate/inanimate</i> — and that returns us to the 'he/hen/hene' of <i>the Etymologies</i>. The real question is: whether in Sindarin maturity there are only <i>he</i> 'he, she' (pun not intended) and <i>ha</i> 'it' (what is the mechanism that always maked all the pronouns lenited <strong>even</strong> in the nominative, eh?), or <i>ho</i> still does work (more fun this way for a practising translator such as myself, in +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#roman-rausch">Roman Rausch</a> 's translation of <i>Gil-Galad</i> I cannot unread 'about her the minstrels sadly sing', _o hen_…); but the evidence for this S-cluster of 3rd person pronouns is quite suggestive.</div>

        <div class="content">1. If you read page 147 of PE17, you'll see that he refers to nasal mutation and contrasts it with vocalic mutation by comparing <i>na</i> (from <i>nan</i>, "with") and <i>an</i> (from the root ANA, "to").<br>2. I'll just quote the passage about nasal mutation in PE17/147:<br>S <i>na</i>, before vowels <i>nan</i> (<i>nasal mutation</i>), means "with" in sense of possessing, provided with, especially of characteristic feature. <i>Orod na Thôn</i>, Mount of the Pine Tree(s). <i>na</i> 'to' and <i>na</i> 'with' are therefore distinct before vowels and <i>b, d, g, p, t, c, m, s</i> but same before <i>h, f, þ, r (rh), l (lh</i>. Late forms as <i>nan-h</i> as for vowels, archaic <i>nath-r, nath-l</i> for <i>nan-rh, nan-lh. nan|sr > nassr > nathr. nað</i> before <i>r</i> (<i>nan-r >naðr</i>).<br><br>This shows what we used to think would be a case of "long nasal mutation" as just regular nasal mutation. Plural "the" <i>in</i> mutates the same way that <i>nan</i> does. Tolkien refers to the mutation used with <i>an</i> as vocalic mutation consistently, through both versions of the 'dative/allative base' entries in PE17. Therefore, the mutation used in <i>an</i> is not nasal mutation. It's "vocalic", but not quite fitting into the traditional vocalic system, but instead, behaving a lot like the preposition <i>en</i> (of the).<br><br>Tolkien only mentioned the spelling of <i>an</i> changing before a <i>b</i> or <i>m</i>, not before any other letters. Though, frustratingly, he gives so little to go on it's hard to say "it is THIS way" with any certainty. We'll just have to wait for that mysterious manuscript that demystifies Sindarin pronouns to come forth.<br><br>I take for the demonstratives, se-close, si-pl.close, sa-far, sai-pl.far. (<i>edro hi ammen</i> and <i>sí nef aear</i> and <i>i thîw hin</i> and <i>im Narvi hain echant</i>) and the <i>ten</i> and <i>ti</i> from Ae Adar Nín as 3rd person pronouns. (note that with all of these, the plural version is a typical Sindarin plural of the singular version) Sindarin and Quenya can have related pronouns without them being the same. I think this is a case of Tolkien re-purposing an old word into something new.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#fiona-jallings">Fiona Jallings</a> I have a feeling we are speaking almost the same things, only in different terminology… I prefer not to apply the word 'demonstrative' for something that is not an adjective and used only substantively. We treat Noldorin information differently: I rather attempt to re-use and fit as much older information as possible while not having more actual one. Indeed they are not exactly alike Quenya ones, with its ending/independent distribution, but Sindarin also does not (as we know yet) possess the KHY-pronoun, and so the actual usage of 3rd person pronouns becomes strange. I don't believe that Tolkien intentionally created such a perfectly gender-equal language, for, especially without the KHY-pronoun for 'another one over there', I don't quite get the idea of the complete impossibility to distinguish 'he' from 'she'. I believe, that with his ordinary carelessness to produce Sindarin grammar compared to Quenya, Tolkien would never do something like that if confronted with conscious desire to complete an inflection table. Thus, Noldorin glosses with their definite gender/animate distribution (and mirroring the <i>-sse/-ssa</i> of Quenya, importantly!) fit very nicely with the fact that the known uses of <i>te</i> are indefinite/far-demonstrative/gender-irrelevant!<br>The same with <i>an-</i> ones: Tolkien never elaborated his mutations to include all the possible initial consonants. He skipped the rare (but trickiest, as it later turns) rh, lh, h, hw quite often (cf. his description of S-assimilation after <i>ah</i> and the original gloss of stop mutation where he only states such form's existence!), and I do not really feel it a violation of Tolkien's word when I extrapolate beyond glossed <i>nm</i>-sitiuation (remember, Tolkien needed it for <i>annin</i> and <i>ammen</i> only!). If he actually tried to employ his neatly described <i>ana</i>-rule to the actual pronouns, he'd stumble into the most violent <i>nl</i> and a much worse <i>ndh</i> which we have no idea how to deal with for it never appears in a native word; there is NO mechanism leading to this cluster beyond the employed here: a compounding or prefixation of something ending with a vowel with its later syncopation! A stop to <i>anden</i> may be expected after Salo's rule 4.117 of un-lenition on morpheme boundary after <i>n</i>, but <i>annen</i>, <i>adhen</i>, even <i>athen</i> are not something to be surprised of!</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#fiona-jallings">Fiona Jallings</a> I'm really no fanfictioner, and my translations normally involve the 'primary world' works, hence I ordinarily employ a kind of 'Received Pronunciation', stabilized as told by Pengolodh to Ælfwine, Sindarin of Nth Age (I did my sonnet as a thing composed by Noldorin poet knowing the accepted norm but making yet mistaked such as mutating beleg > veleg); though the matter of recognizability makes me altering the spelling (I always spell <i>lth</i> to fit <i>the Etymologies</i>, though it is doubtful it was pronounced that way outside Noldorin influence).<br><br>I guess this is unfortunately the way Sindarin study normally works: each and every one of us has one's own personal comfortable headcanon, but when we start showing our ideas to each other we cannot understand half of the tricks we use! Especially in such minor yet important language zones: <i>athar</i> or <i>athan</i>? (I'm all for the first: the only reasoning for <i>athan</i> in mature Sindarin is comparison to late Quenya <i>han</i> of similar meaning — but what is the prefix? Ad/at- 'two'? No meaning! Ath-? The re-derivation of <i>athrad</i> in PE17 as a gerund banished <i>ath</i> stem in favour of <i>thar</i> 'across' < A-THAR! In fact, I'm not doubting the possibility of actual <i>Noldorin</i> <i>athan</i> in SD; only even if it existed, said re-derivation refurbishes into into <i>athar</i> < athār from sundóma reduplication or maybe the 'exactifying' a-prefixation/dynamic lengthening a-ttar, which this time coincide!) I wonder if anyone here has his own ideas to say 'he went'! Event? (Thorsten's) Evenn? (Yours) Evín? (David's) I believe that an analogical past tense 'I drank' is <i>Ŷngin</i> ( ûnc < augm. u-hunc [cf. Etym. Nold.<i>sunc</i>,also auv < a-havw] + in); does anybody agree here at all?<br><br>More to the original point: I decided to search the newer materials for any pronoun discussion. I found in PE21:75: "_Thus  in  unemphatic pronouns  (which  are  archaic  in  form  and  largely  escaped  the  later  inflexional elaborations),  where  two  such  occurred  in  a  sentence,  the  one  nearer  to  the  verb  (or most  closely  agglutinated  to  it)  was  taken  as  the  direct  or  nearer  object;  the  second  was in  function  usually  what  we  should  describe  as  'dative'.  There  was  in  Eldarin  no distinction  felt  or  marked  between  "I  taught  K.  music"  and  "I  gave  K.  a  gift."  In  such cases  in  Eldarin,  <strong>and  some  of  the  derived  tongues</strong>,  it  remained  possible  to  express  both by  uninflected  forms.<i>" Well, in Quenya these cases are explicitly different: by accusative with null and by dative with _-n</i> — then which are 'derived tongues' if not Lindarin branch? A proof it can be, I guess, for a universal 'objective'/oblique form in S. with only a couple fossilized dative elements (annin(?), ammen, enni and the reflexives which are obviously late and different from the rest)!</div>

        <div class="content">The problem with Sindarin is that there is a lot of information missing. If Tolkien ever made charts for mutation - they haven't been published. The Sindarin past tense is still mostly unknown. Pronouns are... let's see, how many are actually attested?
