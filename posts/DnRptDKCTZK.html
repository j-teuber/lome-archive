        <div class="content">+Paul Strack : I'm at a bit of a loss right now figuring out how you arrive at displaying the choice of Glosses as seen on <a class="ext-link" href="http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-311394245.html">eldamo.org - Eldamo : Sindarin : Edhel</a> :<br><br>“Elf” ✧ PE17/045.0905; SA/edhel.001; WJ/377.3002; WJI<br>“Elven” ✧ PM/346.4001-1 (Eðel)<br><br>There are many Ref elements under this Word element <br><word l="s" v="Edhel" speech="n" gloss="Elf" page-id="311394245"><br><br>but how do you decide to display those particular two?<br>The logic I figured out was something like this: <br><br>> display the Gloss and Source attributes of the child Ref elements that:-<br>a) do have a Gloss attribute, and <br>b) refer to the same Form (ie, <i>Edhel</i>) as the parent Word Element<br><br>However, on the Eldamo page there is one that has <i>Eðel</i> as form  ... how do you match that on <i>Edhel</i>? <br><br>There must be some sort of constraint, or otherwise I would think that Ref elements such as<br><ref v="Edhil" source="WJI/Edhel.003" gloss="Elves"><br>would also show up. But they don't. <br><br>Is it maybe some sort of mapping happening, of the <i>ð</i> character on <i>dh</i>? <br>And if so, is there more like that?<br><br>Roman mentioned that Hiswelokë used a "normalised" form that could be used to match things like this; I can imagine that it might be interesting to have something like that. As Roman describes it: <br><br><i>This is also where the scholars/poets distinction comes in. Scholars will want Tolkien's exact spelling, they know what it means and how to use it. Poets will want the normalised form, lest the texts they write become an inconsistent mess.</i><br><br>Ideally, it would be something that can be turned on and off at will. <br><br>Imagine a "Poet | Scholar" switch :)</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lúthien-merilin">Lúthien Merilin</a> The gloss section only shows glosses and sources for uninflected forms. The glosses and sources of inflected forms (e.g. plurals) appear in the inflected section. <br><br>The word entry (both its form and its glosses) are a normalization of the ref elements. As such, the collection of refs into words is necessarily subjective. They are simply my assertion that a set of references are all examples of different forms of the same word. <br><br>Essentially, the refs are the "scholarly" represents, and the word are the "poetic" (or popular) representation, with the caveat that all the words reflect my own biases about Tolkien's languages. <br><br>One final warning: while I generally strive to make the ref elements as objective as I can, they are also filtered through my own knowledge of Tolkien's languages. For example, the nature of some inflections are educated guesses on my part, since the exact inflection is not always explicit in the source material. <br><br>I've been working on the data model for a long time, and the level of rigor I've applied during data entry has not always been consistent. There are numerous cases where the ref entries are not a completely accurate representation of the source material. I am also certain there are numerous typos in the data model; I am constantly finding new ones every time I review the material. <br><br>I am hoping your project can help increase the number of reviewers and improve the quality of the data in the data model. </div>
