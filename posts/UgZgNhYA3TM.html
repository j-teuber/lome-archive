        <div class="content">Hello Paul,  <br>a little group consisting of Roman Rausch, Eryn Galen, Ekin Gören and myself have been trying to settle on an approach for the dictionary project that has come up a couple of times in the past two years (or so). <br><br>Because Eldamo is the best repository (model) of Elvish words there is, we agreed that it would be great if we could use the data of Eldamo for the content of the dictionary. <br>We'd like to know if you are OK with that. <br>I'm aware that you licensed Eldamo under CC BY 4.0 - but that alone feels somewhat formal, if you catch my drift :) -  we'd like to know if you approve of the idea and if you have any ideas about it?<br><br>In order to be able to use those data we think it best to convert it to a relational format from the available XML. I did something similar a few years back with Didier Willis' Hesperides data set, which was also available in XML format (using the TEI schema). Since I still have the perl script somewhere that I created to do that, it shouldn't be too much work to set that up.<br>Changes in the Eldamo data could then be synchronised to the database with little effort. <br><br>Our first aim is to create a relational model that can harbour the same linguistic data collection as we see in Eldamo - e.g. it should be able to cope with changed roots, derivatives, etc., and support multiple Elvish <strong>and</strong> multiple modern languages.<br><br>As our first goal we want to start with the Sindarin entries (all four of us are Sindarin enthousiast, after all) and English and German as modern languages. Adding the Quenya entries and other modern languages can always be done at a later stage. <br><br>Hope to hear from you!<br><br><br><br></div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lúthien-merilin">Lúthien Merilin</a> Yes, feel free to use Eldamo data for your dictionary database. I don't plan on having Eldamo support non-English real world languages any time soon (if ever), so there is definitely a lot of value in such work. <br><br>If in the process of doing data conversions, you notice anything weird or incorrect, please let me know so I can make corrections on my side as well. Be especially wary of the Sindarin data, which is less vetted than the Quenya data (I have more expertise in Quenya). <br><br>This, BTW, is why I gave Eldamo the license I did. There is a lot of value in having shareable data.</div>
