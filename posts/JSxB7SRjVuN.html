        <div class="content">LOTR, FR, Gandalf twice uses the same words to perform a fire spell. What language are his words? What do they mean?<br><br>'The Ring Goes South': Gandalf starts a fire on the mountain with the words: 'naur an edraith ammen!'<br><br>'A Journey in the Dark': Gandalf sets the trees on fire by tossing a burning brand into the air and saying: 'Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!’<br><br>This second is the bigger spell (used when the wolves are attacking). Not understanding the words I find it interesting that he repeats the same words as when he lit the faggot but now adds the additional: <i>Naur dan i ngaurhoth</i></div>

        <div class="content">These are both in Sindarin. The first bit goes something like, "Fire be for the saving of us!" if I recall (though I am away from my notes), while the second one is "Fire against the host of werewolves." <br><br>Since this is just Sindarin and since Gandalf is basically just saying out loud what he is doing, I do not think there is any power in the words themselves, in that if Frodo or Aragorn said them I don't think it would have had the same effect.

At <i>that</i> point in Tolkien's language invention, the Eldarin tongues were conceived as being softening of the hard, unchanging speech of the Valar that was taught to the Elves by Orome.<br><br>Valarin, incidentally, is quite phonologically similar to Old Persian.</div>

And of all the Eldar, the Noldor seem the most likely to compose a "spell." <br><br>That is just a guess and I admit it is a rather tenuous one, but it is important to remember that there is never a final or "fixed" version of Tolkien's languages.

        <div class="content">Here is a little more about Tolkien's conception of the language of the Valar (at the time of the writing of the <i>Lhammas</i> ) and its influence on the languages of the elves. References are from <i>The Lost Road</i>. Please excuse my shoddy notes, as they were jottings to myself for the purposes of my paper on the elves as language inventors.<br><br>On the speech of the Valar:<br><br>‘The speech of the Valar changes little, for the Valar do not die; and before the Sun and the Moon it altered not from age to age in Valinor. But when the Elves learned it, they changed it from the first in the learning, and softened its sounds, and they added many words to it of their own liking and devices even from the beginning. For the Elves love the making of words, and this has ever been the chief cause of the change and variety in their tongues.’ (Lost Road, p. 168) <br><br>On Quenya:<br><br>‘the Elves much altered the tongue of the Valar, and each of the kindreds after their own fashions. The most beautiful and the least changeful of these speeches was that of the Lindar, and especially the tongue of the house and folk of Ingwe [footnote written after main text- ‘….their grammar and vocabulary remained more ancient that those of any other Elvish folk’]….and for long this language was chiefly used in inscriptions or in writings of wisdom and poetry…..It was called by the Gods and Elves ‘the Elvish tongue’, that is Qenya and such it usually named….This is the Elf-Latin and it remains still.’ (Lost Road, p. 172) <br><br>On Noldorin (which eventually grows/changes to become Sindarin):<br><br>‘Now as ages passed and the Noldor became more numerous and skilled and proud, they took also to the writing and using in books of their own speech beside the Qenya; and the form in which is earliest written and preserved in the ancient Noldorin or Kornoldorin, which goes back to the days of the gem-making of Feanor son of Finwe. But this Noldorin never became fixed, as was Qenya, and was used only by the Noldor, and its writing changed in the course of years with the changes of speech and with the varying devices of writing among the Gnomes…And the fruit of their spirit were many works of exceeding beauty and also much sorrow and grief.’ (Lost Road, p. 174)<br><br>And an interesting note on the languages of the Orcs:<br><br>‘Orquin, or Orquian, the language of the Orcs, the soldiers and creatures of Morgoth, was partly itself of Valian origin, for it was derived from the Vala Morgoth. But the speech which he taught he perverted wilfully to evil, as he did all things, and the language of the Orcs was hideous and foul and utterly unlike the languages of the Qendi.’ (Lost Road, p. 178) <br><br>Tolkien eventually drops the idea of Quenya and the other Eldarin languages being derived from Valarin, and they become derived from a proto-Quendi instead.</div>

        <div class="content">I think the reason that Tolkien uses Sindarin when Gandalf uses magic is a literary reason, not a world building one. It makes it more obvious that he's using magic, makes it feel more mysterious and magical, because the average reader won't be able to understand it.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#richard-rohlin">Richard Rohlin</a> Funny thing is, "you" actually is the plural/formal (you may know this being studied in linguistics, in which case, I apologize if I sound patronizing) and "thou" is the singular/informal. It's become funny to me, to listen to people or read things that are meant to sound "fancy" and "respectful" use Thou (which would denote intimacy or disrespect).</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#chris-blackford">Chris Blackford</a> Going even farther back to Anglo-Saxon, you have a singular form ('thu'), a dual form ('git') and and a plural form ('ge', pronounced 'ye'). It is the accusative form of the latter, 'eow,' which is the precursor of our modern 'you.'<br><br>My favorite example of anachronistic use of ungrammatical language is in the traditional Christmas Carol "God Rest You, Merry Gentlemen." Some modern hymnals render it as "God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen" which is of course completely incorrect as "Ye" is in the Nominative case. But at some point after "ye" had fallen out of regular use, someone replaced the "you" with it to make this (already rather old) carol sound more old-fashioned.</div>

        <div class="content">I'm going to <strong>really</strong> nerd out in the following statement:<br><br>I just re-read the above mentioned paragraph, and it says: <br><br><strong>"...and then with a word of command..."</strong><br><br>Now, to <strong>me</strong> it sounds not like a spell in the traditional sense, i.e. something anyone can read/say and the magic will happen. It almost sounds like (and this is where the nerdy comes in) a <strong>feat</strong> ala D&D. That would mean that Gandalf is using his staff as a magic focus (an item used to concentrate magical energies, like a wand or a staff), then he uses the Sindarin phrase as his vocal component, activating the "feat". As to why Sindarin and not another language? My guess would be that it was the first language he spoke when he arrived on Arda? He is, after all, a native of Valinor, and may have been imbued with a magical understanding of the languages of Middle Earth, but being more closely related to Elves than to men...well, you see my point I hope.<br><br>Here's something fun I just started to piece together though: Gandalf carries Narya, which gives hope to the allies of it's wielder,  and that's exactly what happens in that instance.</div>

        <div class="content">In support of the last post: when we get to Moria (which is very soon after the two fire incidents mentioned) Gandalf himself explicitly talks of spells, and even counter spells (the scene when he first encounters the Balrog, who is on the other side of a door they are both putting spells on).</div>

        <div class="content">A very interesting discussion. I think, however, everything is simpler: Olórin (Gandalf, if you like) is a maia sent to the Earth. Eldar are (or, at least, were) able to communicate with the Valar (I wouldn't call it "praying", since, first of all, it is not a pagan term, and secondly, they often got audible - or telepathical, if you prefer, - answers from the Gods). An act of Middle-Earth magic is nothing more (and nothing less) than a rite of calling the Valar. It is quite natural that it was done in an Eldarin language. Actually, Olórin perhaps didn't need such verbalization per se, but it could help him to concentrate.</div>
