        <div class="content">I said I'd post more about “what's next” for Eldamo, so here it is.<br><br>Given my recent posts, it’s no secret that I think we need a generally improved Elvish vocabulary, and ideally some kind of normative dictionary in much the same way we have normative grammars. I intend to move Eldamo in the direction of providing such a dictionary, or providing a solid baseline of data so that it could be used for community-driven efforts.<br><br>However, one of the main values to Eldamo as it stands now is that it does a reasonably good job of documenting Elvish as Tolkien actually wrote it, with all its contradictions. I very much don't want to lose this. Going forward, Eldamo is going to have two missions: (1) descriptive (listing the things Tolkien actually wrote) and (2) proscriptive (indicating how such words might best be used in Neo-Elvish communication).<br><br>Towards this end, I plan on introducing two new languages: Neo-Quenya and Neo-Sindarin. I will use these languages as a basis for my “proscriptive” ideas. Tolkien’s languages Quenya, Qenya, Sindarin, Noldorin, Gnomish will be reserved purely for descriptive purposes.<br><br>Right now there are some “Quenya” and “Sindarin” words that really should be marked “Neo-Quenya” or “Neo-Sindarin”. For example, <i>raen</i> “crooked” is a phonetic adaptation of N. <i>rhaen</i>. Strictly speaking, this is not something Tolkien ever wrote, so it should be Neo-Sindarin. I plan on reassigning a fair number of entries like this to the two new languages. I also intend to get more rigorous about how I use the “reliability” markers for words (#, *, ?, !, ^ etc.).<br><br>This is a big undertaking, and I have no idea how long it will take. I plan on a “first pass” cleanup of Eldamo for the next release (0.6.1), fixing the reliability markers and language assignments.<br><br>After that (or possibly at the same time) I intend to get serious about evaluating Quenya and Sindarin phonetic rules. I’ve already done a first pass at Early Quenya, Gnomish and Noldorin phonetic, but I need to cover the later languages and get more rigorous about it.<br><br>I also need to start incorporating information from secondary sources like Salo’s “Gateway to Sindarin”, numerous online articles on the languages and so forth, and start including higher-quality neologisms from such projects as Helge Fauskanger’s Quenya Bible project. Not to mention reviewing all the material for errors (of which I am sure there are a large number).<br><br>So yeah ... even though the data entry is “finished” there is still a lot more to do.</div>
