        <div class="content">For LL from LTH, I don't use /ɬɬ/ because that's not how it is described in LotR. I've elected to use LotR-era information rather than later information because I don't want to use stuff that contradicts information in LotR.<br><br>For the HR/RH parts - which set are you referring to? There's mine which use /ʀ/ and my roommate's which use /r̥/. He's not a linguist or an Elvish-enthusiast, so he had a lot of difficulty producing the sound.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#fiona-jallings">Fiona Jallings</a> Isn't /ʀ/ french R? Anyway, apparently it's a man's voice pronoucing RH/r̥/. I think it can be misleading. <br><br>My focus was not on LL from LTH. I'm saying "(LH) Pronounce it /ɬ/" this part seems not correct because Tolkien said in the Appendix that "L represents more or less the sound of English initial L, as in let. . . . LH represents this sound when voiceless (usually derived from initial sl-)." 'S' in 'sl-' is voiceless so it affects 'L' making it voiceless. If L is VOICED alveolar lateral APPROXIMANTS, LH should be VOICELESS alveolar lateral APPROXIMANTS/l̥/ not  voiceless alveolar lateral fricatives/ɬ/ which is Welsh LL and sounds more or less similar to /ʃ/.<br><br>Though, I admit I'm not a linguist and not familar with /l̥/ sound. I'm not 100% sure about my argument but just want give some help, if possible, to your already  wonderful work.</div>

        <div class="content">I must have gotten the video and the post mixed up. I use the French R because I was born with a bound tongue and it wasn't corrected until I was 14. Rolling Rs is REALLY difficult for me, and I have been trying to train my tongue to learn how for the past 17 years. <br><br>As for the LH, I picked up the habit from Hiswelókë.</div>

        <div class="content">It's more that since I picked up that idea I hadn't thought about it - nothing had challenged it. I used to mark it as /l̥/ before I examined the way that Hiswelókë did their transcriptions, and since I designed my pronunciations to match the data in Hiswelókë, I hadn't thought about it since then, which was... 10 years ago? But going back over the source material, you're right, Hiswelókë made an error, and I copied that error.</div>
