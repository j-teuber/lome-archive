        <div class="content">My apologies for this being somewhat out of the blue, but I feel that I should mention it here. <br><br>This is for anyone who has known Paul Frank from Australia (he has been known to use the aliases 'Huanarmo' and 'Iverindor'): I received an email from his wife Paddy who told me that Paul has passed away on March 10.<br><br>If you have indeed known him, I'm not telling anything new if I say that he was a remarkable, generous and gentle soul. I never had the chance to meet him in person; but he, Eryn Galen, and I regularly chatted about, and studied Sindarin together via Skype. <br><br>Paddy asked me if I know anyone in Australia (preferably in the Melbourne area) who might me interested in the linguistic material that Paul has worked on during his life.<br><br>Unfortunately, I don't; and the Tol Harndor chapter seems to be defunct since several years. I did write to David Powell, the contact mentioned on their website, and I'll wait and see if he replies. <br><br>I can't say anything more about what that material is:  Paul didn't mention it in our Skype talks.<br><br>If anyone else here knows of anyone in Australia who might be interested, please let me know and I can pass that on to Paddy.<br><br>Thanks for your consideration.<br><br>Lúthien <br><br></div>
