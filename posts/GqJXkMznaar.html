        <div class="content">For Q chatting it would seem fitting to have a Q word for the English language. There is the very early Q word <i>Ingilnóre</i> "England" that seems based on long-since-superseded mythology equating England with <i>Tol Eressea</i> and <i>Ingil</i> as a personal name of a particular English lord, so using <i>Ingil</i> or <i>Ing</i> as a stem feels awkward conceptually and phonologically (<i>ln</i> would presumably become <i>ld</i>, <i>Ingil</i> + <i>-rin</i> would presumably give assimilated <i>?*Ingillin</i>, and <i>?*Ingilnórerin/Ingildórerin</i> or <i>?*Ingilnórin/Ingildórin</i> would presumably translate as "Englandish"). There's similarly old Gnomish <i>Sacthodhrin</i> "English (language)" but <i>Sactha</i> seems to come from a root meaning "fierce hatred, revenge". Any ideas?</div>

        <div class="content">While Ingil- no longer makes sense in the fictional context of Tolkien’s world, I think it is still a plausible phonetic adaptation of Engl- so I would continue to use Ingilnóre. If so, Ingillin or Ingilin seems fine for “English”. <br><br>If you don’t like that, maybe Angalnóre and Angallin, with the assumption that the Elves named the land while it was still inhabited by the Angles. Early Quenya Angali = “Angles” is attested. </div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a>​ I like the idea of phonetic borrowing for country names as it seems extensible to most such names like Tamas' <i>Madyarnóre</i> for Hungary and Helge Fauskanger's <i>*Mirra</i> "Egyptian (not language)" and <i>*Mirrandor</i> "Egypt". It's interesting to explore ways to do it in various cases.</div>

        <div class="content">Based on <i>Angal</i>, one interesting (and perhaps slightly overthought) notion is to derive a general adjective <i>*Angalya</i> “English, of the English people” that could also be used nominally to mean the English language, paralleling the word <i>Quenya</i> itself. That could give <i>Angal, *Angalya</i> “(an) Englishman”, <i>Angali, *Angalyar</i> “Englishmen (general plural)”, <i>*Angallie, *Angalyalie</i> “the English people”, *Angaldóre, *Angalyandóre “England”, and <i>*Angalyarin</i> n. and adj. “English (language, racial adj), the English (people)”. The masochistic could inflect that for possessive/adjectival: <i>*Angalyarinwa</i>, an adjective-like noun from a nominalized adjective from a nominalized adjective from a noun. :)</div>

        <div class="content">I think you are going a bit over board. The -rin suffix is already adjectival. Just as “English” is both an adjective describing the people of England and a noun for their language, Telerin is both a adjective meaning “of the Teleri” and a noun for their language. From this, you can get an adjectival form Telerinwa “of the Telerin language”. </div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> I agree concerning the superfluity: it was moreso a playful/amusing excursion into hypotheticals that Tolkien's linguistic framework allow rather than a serious attempt to coin words. Compare my reconstruction of the "past future perfect particular infinitive": not necessarily wrong but quite impractical. I've always had very intense enthusiasm toward my interests, as is common among persons with what used to be called Asperger syndrome. I would probably choose <i>Angalin</i> for euphony (keeping the stress on the first syllable) in serious usage.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ицхак-пензев">Ицхак Пензев</a> I think that it doesn't fully fit as <i>dy</i> isn't permitted. I don't want to speak for anyone but as far as I can tell, the challenge is that primitive postvocalic <i>g</i> as in Hungarian <i>magyar</i> became <i>ȝ</i> and later disappeared completely as in <i>*lugne > *luȝne > lúne</i> "blue" (HKF's paper "The Evolution From Primitive Elvish To Quenya") and lengthened the preceding vowel when followed by a consonant, giving <i>magyar > máyar > maiar</i>, a name with rather positive connotations but sounding somewhat different from <i>magyar</i>. On the other hand, <i>madyar > malyar</i> or, based on at least one irregular case, <i>madyar > maðyar > mazyar > maryar/masyar</i>, which to me still don't sound particularly similar to the original. Since <i>d</i> can exist independently in at least Vanyarin Q (<i>aldudenie</i>), perhaps <i>Madyar</i> is close enough to Q. I'll reply to your Hangouts msg now. :)</div>
