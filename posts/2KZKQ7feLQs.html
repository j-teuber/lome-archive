        <div class="content">I’m trying to better understand how participles, gerunds, (particular) infinitives, etc. function and interrelate in Quenya. Some sample sentences:<br><br><i>Navin i …</i> ‘I judge that …’<br>1) ‘your doing it’<br>1a) <i>lyenya carilas</i><br>1b) <i>carielyas</i> (not valid because this example is particular and gerund is general?)<br>1c) <s><i>caritalya sa</i></s><i> caritalyas</i><br>1d) <s><i>lyenya caritas</i></s><i> carilalyas</i><br>2) ‘your having done it’<br>2a) <i>lyenya cáriélas</i><br>2b) (equivalent does not exist as gerund is always general and aorist?)<br>2c) <s><i>cáriétalya sa</i></s><i> cáriétalyas</i><br>2d) <s><i>lyenya cáriétas</i></s><i> cáriélalyas</i><br><i>… mára (ná).</i> ‘… is good.’<br><br>Which of these are valid and why?

        <div class="content">Perhaps there is insight in my perfect tense sample: I'm far from clear on whether the <i>​-ita</i> infinitival/gerundial suffix can be affixed to verbal stems other than the bare, unconjugated ones, and if not, how else do we form phrases such as ‘your having done it’, though they may not be preferred? If I understand the grammar correctly, such a participle would need to be regarded as a noun (nominalized?) for a possessive in any form to make sense, and Q adjectives (including participles: I'm thinking of n. <i>eala</i> "(naturally discarnate) being") can sometimes act in this way but I'm unsure how freely this usage is permitted or under which circumstances. It feels in a language this broad like there should be some way of expressing such a structure.</div>

        <div class="content">My general feeling is that active and passive participles function exclusively as adjectives, that gerunds function exclusively as nouns and the general infinitive is exclusively verbal in function. <br><br>I don't think the general infinitive can be inflected in any way, and can only be used in verbal phrase such as:<br><br><i>merin mene</i> "I want to go"<br><br>In case where it appears the infinitive is inflected, the verb is most likely actually in the aorist tense. After all, the infinitive is essentially an uninflected aorist. <br><br>It would not be appropriate to use a general infinitive as a subject of a verb, like in English "to go is wise". You would need to use a gerund or a particular infinitive. <br><br>I think you would need to use a particular infinitive if you wanted to add object suffixes to the infinitive, such as:<br><br><i>merin caritas</i> "I want to do it"<br><br>I also think the particular infinitive can also serve as a pseudo-noun in a cupola or similar constructs, and can in this case accept a possessive suffix to indicate the subject. In these cases the tense marker would be on the main verb. <br><br><i>caritanyas mára né</i> "my doing it was good"<br><br><i>caritalyas mára lauva</i> "your doing it will not be good"<br><br>For more complex constructs I think Quenya prefers to use a subordinate clause, as +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> suggested:<br><br><i>merin ya carilyes</i> "I want you to do it, (lit.) I want that you do it"<br><br>To cover the example of "your having done it", remember that the infinitive it essentially timeless and adapts the tense of the main verb. You could say "your having done it was good" simply by:<br><br><i>caritalyas mára né</i> "(lit.) your doing it was good"<br><br></div>

        <div class="content">Actually, I took another look at PE22/154, and there is an example of using and infinitive phrase as the subject of a sentence:<br><br><i>care mára quí tyare naxa</i> "doing good may cause evil"<br><br>Thus I was wrong there. It seems the general infinitive can be used as subject. <br><br>As for PE15/155 where Tolkien says that participles can take possessive suffixes, that doesn't mean they suddenly become nouns. I think they still remain adjectival.<br><br>In theory Tolkien may have meant that the active participle (normally and adjective) may also function like the present participle in English as part of verb phrases: "I was going to the store". Since there are no examples, I'd hesitate to use such a construction. </div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> That's a nice analysis/breakdown and helpful. I do wonder a little at the end about "the infinitive is essentially timeless and adapts the tense of the main verb" due to an earlier era explanation of the aorist "tense" with other tenses as related by the PE22 editors on page 85 and Tolkien on page 95 and applied to active participles on the top of page 107. In essence, aorist constructs there are timeless in being "purely general" in direct contrast to "action contemporary with that of the main verb". I wonder if this idea survived: at least his related perfective participle <i>​-nwa</i> suffixed to the aorist stem survived in Galadriel's Lament (<i>vanwa</i>) and perhaps elsewhere. If so, since in the later formulation the <i>​-ila</i> aorist participle is also used for present tense, how does one express actual time independence from the main verb? I imagine per your insight above that infinitives (including particular) would follow the same rules on timing/tense. I also wonder if the earlier concept of each tense stem being able to function as an infinitive (page 99) survived and, if so, in what way did it evolve? Q is so rich; it is small wonder to me how Tolkien could spend most of his life exploring and developing it.</div>
