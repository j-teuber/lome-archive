        <div class="content">Well, the tricky thing is that Lothlórien is not pure Sindarin. The Lórien part of the name is Quenya, given as the name of that land by Galadriel, in part as an adaptation of Nandorin Lórinand "Valley of Gold" but also alluding to the forest of Lórien in Valinor. <br><br>If we knew the true Sindarin name of that land we could resolve the issue, and Tolkien's vacillation on the two roots LOS vs LOR is reflected in the names he considered. In the Etymologies of the 1930s we see N. Lhuien, which points to the root LOS, since intervocalic s vanished in Sindarin, but in his notes on names in the Lord of the Rings from the 1950s he considered S. Lothlýrian and Lothlúrien, both of which point to the root LOR. <br><br><a class="ext-link" href="http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-478096257.html">http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-478096257.html</a><br><br><a class="ext-link" href="http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-773877043.html">http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-773877043.html</a></div>

This was a cluster of rrots to solve three steps after the current one! As I glance to my preliminary notes: indeed, when preparing QE in the long run (DLN, lare 50s) Tolkien definitely uses LOS for snow-connected meanings (later, when he abandons NIKW for that — in QE proper — it loses any alternative), so LOR for 'dreaming' become only fitting what remains. And I think there are no later rethinkings here.</div>
