        <div class="content">A sad +<a class="tag" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#storyofaroot">#StoryOfARoot</a> that is, a story of forgetfulness and forgetfulness and oscillations. Curiously, the situation in the <i>Lexicons</i> is remarkably similar to what we are going to obtain decades later, with the alterations really going full circle.<br>* <strong>1910s</strong> The <i>Lexicons</i> distinguish two separate roots: TEKE 'make marks' (QL:090, GL:040, 068-9), with such derivatives as 'mark, write' (<i>teke, tectha</i>), 'pen' (<i>tenka, tenc</i>), 'book' (<i>tekka/tekte</i>) and 'letter, mark, sign' (<i>tet, taith</i>); as opposed to TEÑE 'feel, understand' (QL:091), providing <i>tenge</i> 'to know', <i>tengwe</i> 'knowledge, understanding' etc.<br>* However, a root TEHE 'pull?' (QL:090, GL:069) is also of importance. It provides the stems for 'track, path, line' (<i>tie, tê/tî</i>), 'straight' (<i>tína, tain < tegna</i>), which persist to PE13:153 and survive to the Etymologies with the minimal change (perhaps, due to the importance of the 'Straight Road' concept to Tolkien).<br><br>In <i>the Etymologies</i>, the two stems were initially given as follows:<br><br>* <strong>1937</strong> Easier stem TEK 'make a mark, write, draw': in Quenya, <i>tec</i> 'write', <i>tehta</i> 'sign, diacritic', <i>tekil < tekla</i> 'pen'; <i>tengwe < tekmē</i> 'writing', <i>tengwa</i> 'letter' etc. Also <i>tenkele</i> 'spelling system', <i>tekko</i> 'stroke of pen'. In Noldorin the verb is <i>teitha</i>, 'mark' <i>teith</i>.<br>TEγ 'line, direction' initially given as a basis for Q <i>tie</i> 'path', N <i>tê</i>; <i>téra, tîr</i> 'straight, right'. Then the stem was altered to TEÑ (<i>téra < teñrā</i>), and at a very late stage the new form was re-inserted into its proper place (but with a very complicated reading and many alterations), changing its derivatives in the way into Q <i>téma</i> 'row, series, line', <i>tea</i> 'straight road'; N <i>tî < tēñe</i> 'line, row', <i>tœr, taer < teñra</i> 'straight'. Cf. <i>malle téra lende númenna</i> in the Lament of Atalante, featuring a different word for 'way' but the same as here for 'straight'. The addition of the new stem might be connected with the word <i>indîw, innîw</i> on the Moria gate drafts; Tolkien was already dissatisfied with TEK as its ultimate derivation.<br><br>This dissatisfaction (and a required alteration of all Quenya phonology concerning nasals in contact) can be traced through the whole of further changes. Consider WPP and its drafts:<br><br>* <strong>After 1955</strong> The explanations of Moria gate. Verb <i>teitha</i> is derived from <i>tektā</i> in both draft and final source (PE17:043) and compared to Q <i>tehta</i> 'diacritic', S <i>teith, taith</i> same. Yet, the gloss of TEK 'make a written mark' does not exclude the possibility of remaining bare <i>tec</i> in Q, which is not discussed at all. The formula <i>i thîw hin</i> makes more complications: while in 1955 in a letter to Masson he still has no doubts that <i>tengwa, tew</i> are from <i>tekmā</i>, but as early as the draft an alternative TEÑ emerges (ibid.:044), first as a possible second derivation ('or both true!'), then the only possible. A reminder is put to alter the phonology such.<br>Characteristic of this process are the changes in the <i>Outline of Phonology</i> (see PE19:086): initially rewritten from OPD as such (favouring <i>tengwa</i> from TEK) and only then altered. However, as Tolkien noted already in WPP, the 'instrumental' suffix <i>mā</i> itself (cf. <i>yulma</i>) is not really fit to form a name for 'letter' ('_tekma_ would be a pen'), and yet <i>tengwar</i> are attested and must be accounted. So the alterations actually make not only <i>km > kw</i> but <i>ñm</i> > <i>m</i> with nasalization of the previous vowel! The only way out is now <i>ñw</i>, which is what Tolkien employs: ibid.:097.<br><br>* <strong>late 1950s</strong> This is the pattern observed in a carefully composed essay <i>Quendi and Eldar</i>: <br>(QE:394) "…the Loremasters, therefore, did not use <i>lambe</i> as a term for language or speech in general. Their terms were derived from the stem TEÑ 'indicate, signify', from which was formed the already well-known word teñwe > Q tengwe 'indication, sign, token'. From this they made the word tengwesta 'a system or code of signs'."<br><br>Therefore, the structure of the stems can be explained as following: TEÑ 'indicate' as the basis for <i>tengwa</i> (S <i>têw</i>) vs. TEK 'write' yielding <i>tehta, taith</i>. The remainder is given in the changes to the <i>Outline of Phonology</i>:<br><br>* "Owing to the disappearance of medial ñ the historical developments retaining a stem-nasal were specially liable to later alteration. Thus tēma, series, fr[om] TEG 'line': tegma, direct[ion], process > teñma > tēma. <…> The historical forms that survive were usually grammatically or etymologically isolated in the speech-feeling of Quenya-speakers: as tenna 'a thought, notion, idea' from base TEÑ; since[?] teñgwa, sign, indicator[?], letter is[?] from teñwā".<br><br>So, <i>téma</i> is explained here as a derivative of a different root, TEG 'line', obviously the same that produces (in hiatus) <i>tegē > tie</i> 'road'.<br><br>Now we shall observe whether the latest sources add to or contradict the established scheme somehow. Apparently, there is at least one attempt to rewrite this:<br>* <strong>1969</strong> PE22:149 repeats the same argument of TEK unavailable for <i>tengwa</i> and re-introduces TEÑ, but continues with some charts of phonetic development which would give <i>tegma > tengwa</i>. The word <i>téma</i> become inexplicable in this set-up (unless reassign both it and <i>tie</i> to a non-attested TE3, which is beyond the stretch of reconstruction).<br>* <strong>1960s</strong> VT49:48 mentions a weak verb <i>tengwa</i> 'to read written matter', which is obviously derived from the noun and gives no additional information.<br><br><i>Significatio.</i><br><br>The situation described in QE and OP is most concise and carefully emerging, and I think PE22 additions can easily be passed on as an experimentation. A further confusion arises due to the connected (though barely intersecting) stems TEN 'direction, end', mostly (if not ever) invoked to explain <i>tenna</i> in Elendil's Oath, and strange TAN 'sign' homonymous to TAN 'construct' in Sindarin and apparently appearing only in a star's name, <i>Tannacolli/Tengyl</i> (the difference from TEÑ is doubtful, but can presumably be drawn as 'sign, symbol, vessel of meaning' vs. 'sign, token, message sent'?)<br><br><i>Next time: something concerning BA and WA and a reconstruction of a missing piece of 'Quendi and Eldar'.</i></div>
