        <div class="content">A question posted over at Elfdict got me thinking on our two attested words glossed as "more". We have the adjective <i>amba</i> and the adverb <i>ambe</i> and I am trying to figure out the correct/intended usage for these. Adjectives qualify nouns whereas adverbs qualify the verb (or rather the predicate?) so the two mores should somehow reflect it. The adverb is easy - it can be used in sentences like "I like chicken more than any other meat" <i>Porokelle mára nin ambe lá/epe *ainima exa hráve.</i>, as "more" here qualifies "like". But how did Tolkien imagine <i>amba</i> the adjective? Is it in fact an alternative to the intensifying prefix am(a)-? Can we say <i>Túro amba halla epe Marko</i> "Túro is taller than Marko"? Or is this "more" restricted to more in quantity, as in "I want more bread" <i>merin amba masta</i>?<br><br>What do you think?</div>

        <div class="content">Hmm. Since they share the same origin, I think <i>amba</i> could serve as an alternate way to form an intensive adjective, but my intuition is that it would be more emphatic than the normal intensive: “even more” or “very much”, similar to emphatic pronouns.<br><br>So <i>nán amba </i><s><i>alasse</i></s><i> alassea cene tye</i> “I am very much (or even more) happy to see you”<br><br>I could see children stacking intensifiers for further emphasis: <i>nán anamba alassea cene etye</i> “I am even <strong>even</strong> more happy to see <strong>you</strong>”.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#björn-fromén">Björn Fromén</a> we don’t have much information on how adverbs behave in Quenya, but they may not function the same way as in English. According to PE17/73-74, at the very least adverbs from adjectives were used less often than in English, with a simple adjective used instead. There are other examples of abstract nouns being used where adverbs might be in English (PE17/58-59 and PE17/93-94).<br><br>It is my opinion that Quenya would string together adjectives where English might use an adverb, for example saying “a moderate joyful celebration” rather than “moderately joyful”. Based on this, I’d use adjectival <i>amba</i> in front of another adjective in a noun phrase rather than adverbial <i>ambe</i>, and limit the adverb primarily to modifying verbs.<br><br>Since we have no examples one way or another, this is just a guess on my part, however.</div>

        <div class="content">There is a difference between those two in Polish. We say <i>bardziej radosny</i> 'more joyful' but <i>więcej radości</i> 'more joy' using different adverbs. The first one answers the question <i>jak?</i> 'how' (whereas adjectives answer the question <i>jaki?</i> 'what kind is it?'), the second belongs to the group answering different questions (how much, how often, where, when). <br>By this analogy I would use adjectives before adjectives, other adverbs and verbs (when they answer the question 'how'), but adverbs before nouns and verbs (when they answer the other questions).<br>But it's only a speculation of course.</div>

Consider these two English sentences:<br><br>“I saw quickly a dying man.”<br><br>“I saw a quickly dying man.”<br><br>But in Quenya: <i>cennen lintave quelesta Atan</i>.<br><br>With its freer word order and lack of indefinite article, I think Quenya would need to be more rigid about the grammatical function of adverbs. In particular, I think they should modify either the verb or the context of the entire sentence, whereas nouns and noun phrases should only be modified by adjectives. I think I would write:<br><br><i>cennen lintave quelesta Atan</i> “I saw quickly a dying man”<br><br><i>cennan linta quelesta Atan</i> “I saw a quick[ly] dying man”<br><br>Granted, this introduces a new ambiguity: is the man “quickly dying” or both “quick and dying”. Still, I think this could generally be deduced from context and where it couldn’t, it could be managed by shorter vs. longer pauses between the adjectives: <i>linta-quelesta</i> “quick-dying” (a near compound) vs. <i>linta quelesta</i> or even <i>linta yo quelesta</i>. <br><br>Granted, this is all pretty speculative, but I like that it makes Quenya grammar more distinct from English, and it seems be in the spirit of what Tolkien wrote about the limited use of adverbs in Quenya.</div>

        <div class="content"><i>-sta</i> is a verbal noun ending, IMO what you need here is an active participle (<i>quelila</i>); we also have <i>lintie/lintiénen</i> attested as the adverbial form of <i>linta</i>.<br>This ambiguity arises in this particular case because Q does not have an indefinite article which would separate the noun phrase ("I saw quickly <strong>a</strong> dying man" "I saw <strong>a</strong> quickly dying man"); but as soon as we're talking about a specific man the ambiguity disappears (<i>kennen lintie i quelila Atan/kennen i lintie quelila Atan</i>).

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lokyt-l">Lokyt L.</a> I agree that we are in broad alignment, and that the main open question is whether Quenya adverbs can modify adjectives. Since we have no clear attested examples, any “answer” must be speculative and subject to our personal tastes. I also think there's an interesting discussion to be had on the behavior of verbal participles as adjectives, but I would rather defer that to a separate thread.<br><br>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> I agree that my choice of <i>quelesta</i> “dying” was a poor one. It is an attested adjective, but it is “Middle Quenya” from the period when the verbal noun prefix was <i>-ste</i>. This conflicts with later form of the verbal noun suffix as you pointed out, so I agree that <i>quelila</i> is a better choice.<br><br>My choice of <i>lintave</i> over <i>lintie</i> is, however, more deliberate. In particular, I don’t think that <i>lintie</i> is actually an adverb, but is rather an abstract noun (“swiftness, speed”) which <i>may be used as an adverb</i> to modify a verb.<br><br>I think the phrases on PE17/58-59 make this clear:<br><br><i>norne lintie</i> “he ran quickly, (lit.) he ran [with] swiftness”<br><br>This is even clearer with:<br><br><i>norne lintieryanen</i> “he ran as swiftly as he could, (lit.) he ran with his speed”<br><br>Since <i>lintieryanen</i> is in the instrumental case, it is definitely being used as a noun.<br><br>The fact that so many Quenya adverbs (<i>lintie, márie, laurie</i>) also function as abstract noun is one of the reasons why I think Quenya would not use “adverbs” to modify adjectives, only verbs. Allowing nouns to modify adjectives would be extremely counter-intuitive.<br><br>I chose the more “adverbial” <i>lintave</i> in my examples above because I think it is conceivable that it could be used to modify an adjective, even though I personally would prefer to use <i>linta</i>. However, I think the chances that <i>lintie</i> “swiftness, speed” could be used to directly modify an adjective is extremely low.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> <i>Lintieryanen</i> is an instrumental of a noun? That's interesting, 'cause some natural languages (my native included) really can create adverbs from nouns by simply switching them to the instrumental case. And what is of relevance, these desubstantival adverbs CAN (at least in some Slavic languages) modify adjectives, BUT only deverbal ones, i.e. participles; not the true, primary adjectives.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lokyt-l">Lokyt L.</a> Tolkien classified certain noun cases as “adverbial”.

        <div class="content">It depends on the time period. In later writings it’s the allative, ablative and locative cases (and maybe also instrumental). Earlier there were additional comitative and “adverbial” cases (which I call the similative), but Tolkien seems to have abandoned these.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lokyt-l">Lokyt L.</a> Maybe? It’s hard to guess. Clearly plural and possessive inflections make little sense. But I can imagine other inflections might work. For example:<br><br><i>lauyuvalme ambanen</i> “We will flourish with more”. <br><br></div>
