        <div class="content">Another word analysis, this time for a single word: the conjunction “and”. We know the net result: Q. <i>ar</i> and S. <i>a</i>. Knowing its development is nevertheless very important, because it effects a number of secondary words and its history is very complex.<br><br>In the Quenya Lexicon of the 1910s, the word for “and” is ᴱQ. <i>ya(n)</i> from the root YA, which is possibly a variant of (D)ẎṆTṆ having to do with “(en)large” (QL/104, 106). Meanwhile, the word ᴱQ. <i>ar(a)</i> is glossed “but”, derived from (Ʒ)ARA “spread” (QL/32). In the Gnomish lexicon, however, the word for “and, too” is G. <i>ar²</i> (GL/20, 49), and in the Gnomish Lexicon Slips <i>ar</i> is associated with “besides” (PE13/110). Tolkien began using ᴱQ. <i>ar</i> for “and” in the Oilima Markirya poem of the 1920s (MC/216) and it remained the basic Quenya word for “and” thereafter.<br><br>This scenario is firm in the Etymologies of the 1930s, where ᴹQ. <i>ar</i> “and” is derived from the root AR² whose basic sense is “beside, outside” (Ety/AR²). The related prefix <i>ar-</i> meant “outside, beside” in both Quenya and Noldorin. In Noldorin it developed an additional privative sense “without”, and so appeared in N. <i>arnediad</i> “numberless”, as in the name of the great battle: <i>Nirnaith</i> or <i>Nírnaeth Arnediad</i> “Unnumbered Tears” (LR/147, 310).<br><br>The word ᴹQ. <i>ar</i> is used pretty consistently as “and” in the 1930s and 1940s, although there is one example where it glossed “but” (PE22/124). In notes on Thrór’s Map from “The Hobbit” from 1936, N. <i>ar</i> is also used as “and”, but in the Moria Gate inscription in LotR drafts of the 1940s it has become <i>a</i> as in: <i>pedo mellon a minno</i>. In the published LotR, we have Q. <i>ar</i> and S. <i>a</i>.<br><br>Tolkien revisited the derivations of these words in the 1950s. There are signs he wanted to split up the basic meanings of the root AR² “beside/outside, without”: in a list of prepositions from the 1950s, he had ARA “along side” vs. ADA “against, opposite” (PE43/33). In notes appearing in PE17, Tolkien seems to have flipped this, making AR mean “beyond, further than” (PE17/147) and AD mean “along side, beside” (PE17/145). This new sense “beside” for AD may have replaced its sense from the Etymologies, where ᴹ√AD was glossed “entrance, gate”. The two main derivatives of ᴹ√AD, Q. <i>ando</i> and S. <i>annon</i> “(great) gate”, were both transfered to ANA “to, towards”, having now the original sense “†entrances, approaches” (PE17/40).<br><br>With AD now meaning “beside”, Tolkien devised a new etymology for “and”. The Quenya word remained essentially unchanged, but the Sindarin word <i>a</i> now took the form <i>adh</i> before vowels (PE17/71, 145). To further cement this change, Tolkien seems to have decided that the prefix <i>ar-</i> only meant “beside” in Quenya, not Sindarin, explaining <i>Arnen</i> “beside the water” as a muddled combination of both languages (VT42/17). Presumably the Sindarin prefix <i>ar-</i> retained its privative sense “without” based on its new derivation from AR “beyond”, since Tolkien retained that prefix in S. <i>arnoediad/arnediad</i> “unnumbered”.<br><br>Later still Tolkien considered yet another scenario for “and”, this time using the root AS for “beside”. This still produced Q. <i>ar</i>, S. <i>a</i>, but in Sindarin the prevocalic form was now <i>ah</i> (VT43/30, VT47/31). This last scenario appears in notes from the late 1960s, but Tolkien may have considered it even earlier, since prevocalic S. <i>ah</i> appears in the title <i>Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth</i> from the late 1950s (MR/329). In this scenario, Q. <i>ar</i> was derived from primitive <i>asa</i> “beside”, as <i>asa</i> > <i>aza</i> > <i>ara</i> > <i>ar</i>, with the loss of the final vowel probably due frequent elision.<br><br>This gives us three possible roots for Q. <i>ar</i>, S. <i>a</i> “and”: AR, AD and AS. The main distinctions are in the prevocalic Sindarin form of the word: S. <i>ar</i>, <i>adh</i> or <i>ah</i>. As is typical, Tolkien vacillated a great deal in his later writings, and it is difficult to determine which scenario (if any) he settled on. I think AR “beside” was likely discarded, since S <i>ar</i> doesn’t appear after the early 1950s (its last appearance may be be in Túrin’s Wrapper: VT50/5), but the choice between AD and AS is less clear. Of the two, AS seems to be the “later” scenario (1960s vs 1950s). Normally I don’t give this too much weight, but there are a few words, most notably Q. <i>armaro/asambar(o)</i> and S. <i>sammar/ahamar</i> “neighbor, (lit.) beside-inhabit-er”, that are best explained by AS and not AD.<br><br>I have yet to find any derivatives of AD that cannot be explained equally well by derivation for AS. Therefore, I think it is best to assume Q. <i>ar</i>, S. <i>a</i> < AS, with prevocalic <i>ah</i> in Sindarin. I am not sure what to do with the root AD, since it seems to be no longer necessary, having been replaced by AN (for “gate”) and AS (for “beside”). Unless/until some new form requiring AD is published, I am assuming this root faded into obscurity.</div>
