        <div class="content">The underlying root PHER and all derivatives in both Q and S have connotations “quick, prompt”; therefore, it works for many uses but seemingly not all: “Our new product sold out immediately upon release; it should gradually become available again as we ramp up production.” We could consider removing that connotation in the absence of late attested alternatives or try to coin something else for such non-quick uses. S <i>fergenol</i> “quick to see or perceive, sharp-sighted or witted” seems to require the “quick” sense, and the E etymology of “ready” does have those connotations and other basic senses of “available” (like the supply and demand example above) can mean “obtainable” which one could derive from a different Eldarin root.<br><br>PHER seems naturally related to “prepare = make ready, available”; indeed, the verb in Q and S has this meaning. However, one can question whether or not it would be proper for such uses as “The Valar prepared the world for habitation over many millennia.” although this usage could also mean “prepare = make suitable, fitting” with a different root. The early Q attested words <i>manwa-</i> “to prepare”  and adjective <i>manwa</i> “ready” are derived from a root meaning “cook, bake”. This pattern suggests that perhaps, in Q, translating an E word like “available” would depend on context.<br><br>Part of my reservations with using PHER universally may be the E distinction between “to promptly make available” and “to make (promptly available)”. If one interprets the Eldarin root and derivatives along the latter lines, it may be suitable for most general usage.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#robert-reynolds">Robert Reynolds</a> the fact the (quickly) is in parentheses in the gloss to me suggests that the meaning can be taken more generally.<br>Interestingly, the meaning of 'be at disposal' of E 'available' is a late development, from original 'beneficial'.<br>I think <i>férima</i> is good as 'a' solution, and depending on context one may need to use other constructions like <i>*yuhtalima</i> 'usable', <i>anyalima</i> 'reachable' etc.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> That approach makes sense to me. I had interpreted the parenthesis as indicating that the connotation was implied rather than literal, but I suppose that could end up yielding the same outcome. I’m currently inclined to think that <i>férima</i> is generally suitable for the sense “ready, on hand” of “available”. For the sense “obtainable, possessible”, perhaps <i>*ávima < oa-ima</i>; <i>?*sámima</i> sounds awkward but avoids the AW root conflict and something from ƷAR/GAR may work. For “usable”, YUK does seem suitable, and perhaps KAM for “suitable” as forms like ✶_magrā_ seem rather overloaded to me. ANA does seem fitting for “reachable, obtainable (not possessive sense)”, generally describing something that can go to (is available to) someone; perhaps most general would be <i>*ánima</i>. <i>aþea < aþayā</i> could be treated as an adjective as well as a noun for “beneficial, helpful, willing to assist” for that interesting late development “be at disposal” of “available” (“I’m available to work that extra shift on Saturday”) or one could follow the above pattern with <i>*áþima</i>. Most of these should have Sindarin cognates, too.<br><br>To update <i>manwa</i>, one could try using late MBAS for baked items being ready/prepared, but direct root derivations like <i>?*márima</i> and other vocalic suffixes (and <i>-y</i>) would overlap with MBAR (“habitable”, <i>arta</i>), desirably or otherwise.</div>
