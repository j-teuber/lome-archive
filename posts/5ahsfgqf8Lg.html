        <div class="content">I'm looking for help translating a phrase into Elvish. It can be any version of Elvish you like.<br><br>Here's the story; me and by girlfriend are nearing our marriage and starting a family. We want to have a family motto. In fact we sort of have it, we just don't have a phrase that sums it up. Since LotR has had a huge part of our lives together we feel its only right that the phrase be in Elvish.<br><br>So the idea is we are ambitious and driven people who work really hard. We are entrepreneurs who have a successful business together because we "run" through life. Running is how we refer to spending all day everyday working towards our future.<br><br>The phrase can be anything that instills that meaning. Something we can say to each other that re-affirms our life goals. Similar to saying "I Love You" to each other or saying "Go get 'em". Some examples may be:<br>- i run with you<br>- run with heart<br>- run for life<br><br>The phrase in Elvish needs to be something that rolls off the tongue. Something that sounds really cool. So the literal translation isn't that important.<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to read this and I can't wait to see what you come up with.</div>

        <div class="content">In Quenya:<br><br>"I run with you" = <i>norin le tye</i> or <i>norin o tye</i><br><br>"run with heart" = <i>á nore órenen</i><br><br>"run for life" = <i>á nore ra coivie</i><br><br>Those are rough translation because word like "heart" and "life" and the various prepositions can have many subtle meanings.<br><br>I am pretty sure the first phrase means what you want. There are two variations because there are several prepositions meaning "with" in the sense of "accompanying". <br><br>The second phrase uses the word <i>óre</i> for "heart", but the actual sense of the word is really "inner spirit". I used the instrumental case, so a more accurate translation would be "run by means of inner spirit". <br><br>A more accurate sense of the last phrase would be "run for (on behalf of) being alive". That phrase and the second phrase are both imperatives, that is commands or extortions to take some action (do it). </div>

        <div class="content">I also use Quenya; as a language typically used for ceremony, it seems especially fitting for your situation. I like +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a>'s relatively literal translations of your phrases. +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#александр-запрягаев">Александр Запрягаев</a>'s phrase means 'run faster' through a Quenya idiom; its literal meaning is something like 'run with more running' and is pleasant and fitting to my ears also. Here are a few versions that I made from your basis:<br><br><i>noringwe</i> 'we run'<br>short and sweet, yet personal: 'we' here is inclusive dual form and thus means 'the two of us' or 'you and I', and 'run' is in aorist form and thus means 'run' as a general fact, independent of time<br><i>á nonóra</i> 'keep on running'<br>an imperative with a frequentative version of 'to run' thus with the sense of 'continue to run, continually run'<br><i>cuitaila noriénen</i> 'living through running'<br>a participial phrase; <i>cuitaila</i> is expressed in an aorist sense (time-independent) and <i>noriénen</i> is an instrumental gerund with the sense 'by means of running'<br><i>cuitangwe noriénen</i> 'we live through running'<br>same as above but as a sentence; 'we' again is 'the two of us, you and I'<br><i>á cuita noriénen</i> 'live through running'<br>an imperative version of the above<br><i>á cuita amnórie</i> 'live faster'<br>tricky to translate into English; it is imperative with a version of the Quenya idiom above and literally means 'live with more running'<br><i>illume/tennoio/oio norila/noroite</i> ‘always/forever/ever running’<br>several variants of a participial phrase; the first group of words have similar meanings in context so euphony could decide between them and the second group is the regular active participle in aorist sense 'running' or <i>noroite</i> which means 'capable of running, generally (and naturally) running' or loosely 'full of running' and has some common sounds with <i>tennoio</i> and <i>oio</i></div>
