        <div class="content">Ah, I see, sorry. Here's the story:<br>I'm currently tracing Tolkien's ideas about the semantic field of "will-intention-desire-wish". And at the particular moment, I was interested in the evolution surrounding the roots MEN, MER, MBER, MED and their possible early predecessors (like MEK).<br>So the search aimed at all roots and derivations, regardless of time period, on "m-" or (former) "mb-" with a gloss from the area I mentioned ("want", "wish", "desire", "long", "greed", "lust", "intend", "aim", "goal", "will", "resolve", "mean" etc. etc.).</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lokyt-l">Lokyt L.</a> Ooo. A linguistic research use case. That’s very sophisticated. I wasn’t even aware people were trying to use Eldamo that way.<br><br>I think the best way to support something like that would be the AND, OR keywords you were suggesting earlier, combined with wildcards. For example:<br><br>m* AND (want OR wish OR desire)<br><br>Combined with a language restriction of “All Primitive Elvish”<br><br>The AND, OR keywords would probably be generally useful as well, especially in combination with wildcards. <br><br>I will think about it. If we are going in the direction, search results that are bookmarkable or linkable would also be useful, especially for discussion purposes. </div>

        <div class="content">Er... I thought being used this way was Eldamo's PRIMARY raison d'être :D<br><br>It's true that the combination you suggest ("m* AND ...") would give a limited enough set of results (the number of unwanted entries that would pass would be acceptably small, while no wanted entry would be missed). As it would be the case with probably any complicated search, if one combines wildcards and logical operators smartly enough. Good point.<br>Though I also agree that bookmarkable, linkable and - most importantly - searchable search results would be simply perfect.<br><br></div>
