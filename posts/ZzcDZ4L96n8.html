        <div class="content">Well done guys! Yeah, Ekin, a lot of the poems were disqualified for being unreadable, which was usually because they used Sindarin words with English grammar. I like to call such translations "Sindarish". But, there were also a lot of good poems with mostly correct grammar (at least understandable grammar). In fact there was a tie for first place, and we had a discussion over which poem was just a little bit better. That's why there was the honorable mention in the article.</div>

        <div class="content">Let's see, my notes say - yes, they're unconventional, but acceptable. You lost points for using "nínia-" (to weep) for "to be shed". I think that "eilia-/elia-" (to rain/pour) would have been a better choice. As you have it, the unnumbered tears are the ones who will willingly weep. The last line read as "a curse for the wronged ones", which made the English version inaccurate. The emotion that you were trying to achieve does fit into a haiku very well - haiku work best when you focus on only one thing. In Japanese, it'd often be describing a scene in nature that demonstrates the impermanence of the world, a very important part of Buddhist philosophy. You were focusing on grief caused by war. But, I could tell you were struggling a bit with the syllable restrictions, especially with the last line, which was unconnected and ill-fitting the first two lines of the poem. That was something that a lot of people struggled with - haiku are very different from our European-traditional poetry. So, the last line felt tacked-on to fill the word-count. It works best if the entire haiku is one sentence.<br><br>On a side note, it's actually easier to compose haiku in Quenya, because Quenya phonology and grammar is more like Japanese.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#fiona-jallings">Fiona Jallings</a> Well, haiku are quite popular in Russia, and I've read enough Bashō to get the general idea of how they are made! I'm unable to formulate the precise rules, but just followed the emotional track of those I read, trying to parallel the state of nature with my inner mind (curiously enough, written under a sunny sky and light breeze :D ) and connecting them in a paradoxical way.<br>And, of course, the +<a class="tag" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#pe22">#PE22</a> revelation made me unable to resist and add something with <i>itë,</i> someting with KUB and something with <i>ulo</i>!</div>

        <div class="content">You did a really good job focusing on one emotion. I think everyone at some point in their lives has felt that way. That's what put it above a lot of the other poems, who just described random pretty scenes in nature, not trying to connect them to any feelings or philosophies.<br><br>I had to read a lot of Bashou's poetry for my Japanese classes, mostly for the Japanese religion and philosophy class I took. If you really want to understand Bashou, you need to study the Japanese versions of Buddhism and the time period. Bashou believed that the world was declining, falling into chaos and ruin, as did many philosophers of his time. Thus, a heavy emphasis on "nothing lasts forever."</div>

Too late!

        <div class="content">I think that <i>nínia-</i> would have worked if you'd used the passive-conjugation instead of the future tense. "Unnumbered tears, you <strong>are wept</strong> now." instead of "Unnumbered tears, you will weep now." The later sounds like the tears are doing the action, instead of the action happening to them.</div>
