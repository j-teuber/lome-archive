        <div class="content">Ah yes I'll definitely review it, when I am done reading it! I am currently reading it rather quickly to get a bit an impression, also doing that on the train in the mornings and as it's a bit tricky with it being so crowded i'm skipping the exercises for now.<br><br>It's been very interesting so far and I could already gather some new bits of knowledge, such as distinguishing vocalic mutation into Prestanneth and lenition, so far I used the term lenition for both variants... I love how thoroughly you cover each topic and really rather fill the gaps than circumvent them!<br><br>One small thing I'd like to critize so far tho: On (hardback edition) page 45 where it is about stress of longer words. It starts with the sentence "If the word is 2 or 3 syllables long then the first syllable gets the stress." This sentence imho is a bit misleading, it sounds very final, like 3 syllable words always are stressed on the first syllable, and only words with 4 and more syllables may have the stress on the second-to-last-syllable. I think if I would not have known this rule before I may have misread that.<br><br>I wonder why you decided not to cover the scripts / Tengwar...? As you introduce the dialects from the start already it may have been at hand to link those to the different modes of the Tengwar. Also especially for the non-linguistic readers you aim for it may be great to be able to "show off" and use their knowledge about elvish in using the exotic script and not only the language. Sure the scripts are a lot easier to learn, but still it feels like the book only contains half of the entire picture ;)<br><br>Also, do you intend on issueing any translations? As elvish students are so dispersed I bet this book will fall into many people of different languages (like me from Switzerland), and especially the very detailed pronounciation guide and the exercises to transcript english words to the IPA may be very hard if the reader is not 100% sure how he is supposed to pronounce these english words.</div>

        <div class="content">Re: pronunciation<br>Yeah, you missed the part where I talked about how in 3 syllable words (and longer) the stress always falls on the second or third from last syllables, depending on whether the second to last syllable is heavy.<br><br>Re: Tengwar<br>There were several reasons for that. <br>First, I want to decouple the concepts of translation and transcription.<br>Second, we​ rarely need to use tengwar or cirth online, because writing in it is super clumsy and usually requires uploading and hosting pictures.<br>Third, the easiest to use font doesn't work in Microsoft Word, which is what I used to make the book.<br>Fourth, to teach tengwar and cirth, it requires a lot more space to practice writing, and that doesn't fit in a 6x9 book very well.<br>Lastly, I wanted the paperback book to be under 20$. <br>I didn't come to this decision lightly. So, there's a free tengwar workbook available on my website that you can print out instead.<br><br>Re: translations<br>No idea. If it sells really, REALLY well, then it's possible.</div>

        <div class="content">Pronounciation: You missed my point; of course you do explain that the stress can fall on the second-to-last syllable, but that one sentence above appears before that part and it reads like "all 3-syllable words are stressed on first syllable, regardless of the statements that follow below". It's really a minor thing, in the end it's clear, but when reading that one sentence I was like "Wait, hang on, that does not sound right".<br><br>What do you mean with the Tengwar font not working in MS Word? I am doing transcriptions into Tengwar and Cirth almost daily using word.</div>
