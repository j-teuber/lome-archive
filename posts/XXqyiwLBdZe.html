        <div class="content">Hello! I was wondering what you would use in Quenya for the word "bearing" in this sentence: "You have seen them bearing the cloaks of lords!" This is obviously not a gerund, since this word doesn't take the shape of a noun. Can someone please tell me what would be added to the "col-" for the word "bear", and show me where I can find this? Thank you!﻿</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> You are right. In the original sentence, "them" could only be an object, so there is less ambiguity. By changing the pronoun to "the men", it introduces the possibility that "the men bear the lord's cloaks" is a subordinate clause. In any case, it feels to me that the emphasis is on the verbal action. <br><br>In the second sentence, the clause functions more adjectivally, describing the men. <br><br>I also think that a similar distinction might appear in Quenya as well, since the infinitive is verbal and the active participle is adjectival. </div>

I have also noted, that on p118 of PE22, where Tolkien discusses the accusative with infinitive construct, all his examples are ones where the English counterpart uses the to-infinitive (I wished him to come etc.). Also, he states that with verbs that report, say, state facts this construct cannot be used and Q here uses a clause. Could it be that verbs of perception (see, hear, feel) fall into the latter category? (you have seen them bearing the cloaks = you have seen that they were wearing the cloaks)?<br>Perhaps I am clutching at straws here and it's all very simple and the infinitive should be used; however, I now think that the active participle is not a good solution, unless it actually refers to the main subject of the sentence (you):)</div>
