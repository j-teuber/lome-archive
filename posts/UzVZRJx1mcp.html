        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a><br><br><strong>eldamo-data review</strong><br><br>All queries have been made on the data of eldamo v0.5.5., but as you probably have not changed anything of the existing data these findings should still apply.<br>As promised, here a pretty thorough analysis on the topics of "marks on glosses":<br><br><strong>Question marks [ ? ] in glosses</strong>:<br>There's a total of 301 glosses with one or more question marks within them. <br><br>The largest group, and thus I'd say the "most correct and consistent" layout is where the question mark appears in leading position; this affects 209 of these glosses.<br>10 of those are nothing but a question mark.<br>1 is most likely a typo; it has a space between the question mark and the gloss: <a class="ext-link" href="http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-547886485.html">http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-547886485.html</a><br><br>Next up there's of course some with a question mark in trailing position. Most are "correct" in the sense that the question mark is there because the gloss belongs to a sentence which is a question. It's noteworthy though that there are many conlang words that miss the "?" while the gloss has one.<br><br>However, some of the glosses with trailing question marks are marks for uncertainty of the gloss. It'd be nice if you could change those so that they are in leading position instead as it is not possible to distinct these two cases reliably programmatically:<br><a class="ext-link" href="http://i.imgur.com/GJMk9wl.png">http://i.imgur.com/GJMk9wl.png</a><br><a class="ext-link" href="https://pastebin.com/0zCUqtSg">https://pastebin.com/0zCUqtSg</a><br><br>Now left are 56 entries that have the question mark neither in trailing nor leading position.<br><br>First off there's a small group of glosses which have a leading "?", but all or parts of the gloss, including the question mark, are enclosed in brackets. There's 16 of those:<br><a class="ext-link" href="http://i.imgur.com/V2cxo8i.png">http://i.imgur.com/V2cxo8i.png</a><br><a class="ext-link" href="https://pastebin.com/RmE2qWF2">https://pastebin.com/RmE2qWF2</a><br><br>Brackets may surely make sense to signify that parts of the gloss are uncertain, but for those that are completely contained withing brackets it seems a bit redundant to have both brackets and question mark.<br><br>Then there's three entries that also have the question mark in leading position, but are preceded by "(lit.)": page-id's 1766902045, 98311109, 1622754763<br><br>The remaining 37 are of various nature, but very often the pattern "(?uncertain part of gloss)" appears, so this is also fairly consistent. I am not sure whether the occasional square brackets are intentionally different from round brackets, but I believe there could be some more unification on these entries:<br><a class="ext-link" href="http://i.imgur.com/kUAk7EF.png">http://i.imgur.com/kUAk7EF.png</a><br><a class="ext-link" href="https://pastebin.com/xqDaw9ry">https://pastebin.com/xqDaw9ry</a><br><br><br>Are you interested in fixing such technical things? I'll continue with other marks on glosses for the rest of today, but tell me whether I should continue posting these or whether I should just sort them out on my end.<br></div>

        <div class="content">Next (there's still lots I can check :S) I investigated on the use of the <strong>different bracket types in glosses</strong>:<br><br><strong>Square brackets [ ] in glosses</strong> (count: 246)<br>The usage of these seems to be rather inconsistent. What I see often is situations where in other words round brackets are used, and then the situation where the square brackets mark parts that are not explicitly to be found in the conlang text.<br><br>I'll point out some exemplary words which I think are strange, but I won't identify every single one, unless +Paul Strack really is interested in making the use of brackets as consistent as possible.

        <div class="content">OK, I finally had time to look through this. You've done a lot of good analysis here.<br><br>Unfortunately, I think you are trying to extract a level of meaning from the source data that simply isn't justifiable. At that point in time, the @gloss attributes simply aren't intended to be interpreted by anything other than a human reader.<br><br>There are a lot of inconsistencies in the formats of the gloss data, for a variety of reasons.<br><br>1) The ref/@gloss attributes are intended to be a relatively faithful reproduction of the original gloss from Tolkien. In some cases I have altered the punctuation for clarity, but mostly I tried to record what Tolkien wrote. These glosses cannot be interpreted as anything other than atomic units.<br><br>2) The word/@gloss attribute may eventually be machine parseable, but not in the current (late alpha) stage of the data model. I've only done a full editing pass on a handful of the smaller languages. The larger languages, particular Quenya and Sindarin, have yet only light and preliminary editing passes.<br><br>I have to balance my time between making the current, alpha model useful and pushing forward on completing the data entry. Some things like gloss consistency are just going to have to wait. Cleaning up the glosses in the data model is probably going to be one of the last things I do in the model in the late beta stage of its development. It is the sort of thing I want to do only after all the data entry is done and I have a firm grasp of the conceptual, phonetic and grammatical developments of the languages.<br><br>As you push forward in your own analysis, you are going to reach a point where the data in Eldamo is insufficient for your purposes. At that point, you are going to have to go beyond Eldamo, engage directly with the source material and do your own analysis. You may be reaching that point at least in some areas.<br><br>And I do hope that you <strong>do</strong> go beyond the Eldamo data set. Having other alternate Elvish data models out their will make cross-model analysis possible, which can greatly improve the quality of all the data models. I got a lot of value out of comparing my data set to those of David Giraudeau and the older Elvish dictionaries.<br><br>Anyway, I will try to respond to some of your specific comments above.</div>

        <div class="content"><strong>Brackets, Braces and Parenthesis</strong><br><br>In general, brackets [ ] in glosses represent editorial additions, items added to the gloss that are not present in the original. I use those when making partial additions to glosses, as opposed to marking complete unattested glosses with a “*”.<br><br>Braces { } in glosses represent modifications or deletions, and following the conventions in Parma Eldalamberon. For example:<br><br>“now supposing you asked me, a thing unlikely {or ridiculous} to suppose”<br><br>This indicates that “{or ridiculous}” was present in the original text but deleted by Tolkien.<br><br>Parenthesis appear for a variety of reasons. Sometimes they represent parenthesis in the original. Something they represent brackets in the original, which I changed to parenthesis to make them distinct from editorial additions. Sometimes I added parenthesis of my own for clarity.<br><br>One particular use of parenthesis is for speculative glosses for illegible words in the original text. For example:<br><br><a class="ext-link" href="http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-740582189.html">eldamo.org - Eldamo : Ilkorin/Doriathrin : espalass</a><br><br><i>espalass</i> “foaming (?fall)”<br><br>Here the second word in the original is hard to make out, so the gloss is speculative (generally from the editors of the original material rather than my own speculations).</div>

        <div class="content">Thank you a ton for your work! Don't worry, I won't need to rely on you "fixing" or normalising all these things; the two things I want to achieve by posting these findings is on one hand to point out things that may be indeed wrong and which you'd like to fix and secondly to kinda find out which things I should sort out on my end, which ones I may expect to be changed by you, and which cases I should leave as they are.<br><br>I am now starting to implement a new bunch of things and then send your XML through my code once more.

I still got to see which cases are common and consistent enough to treat them programmatically (I am also considering having the program ask for cases that are unclear, so far no user input is required for the program)<br>- Where the gloss was missing I tried inheriting a gloss of a child element; I will need to revise the situation where a gloss of an <inflect> child gets inherited as I have a few words that have a gloss thats not in the base form.<br>- If glosses from word or ref type "phrase" or "text" contain commas or semicolons, the gloss will not be splitted.<br>- Maybe more....<br><a class="ext-link" href="http://eldamo.org/content/languages/index.html">eldamo.org - Eldamo : Language Index</a></div>

        <div class="content">Okay so just fyi, here's which cases I distinguished on marked glosses:<br><br>- "?Gloss" --> "Gloss" (except "?

Gloss"</strong><br><strong>- "Gloss</strong>" --> "Gloss"<br><br>All extracted marks are stored seperately (translations are stored as entry in the table "has_relation" which contains the ID of the elvish and the english word, and the marks are stored in the table "relation_has_mark" which contains a relation-ID and a mark-ID.<br><br>This yields the following list of glosses (on conlang words, ref's are untouched), that still contain a mark:<br><a class="ext-link" href="http://i.imgur.com/6vt1gj7.png">i.imgur.com</a><br><br>Especially noteworthy: I now added the rule, that "phrase" and "text"-glosses are no longer split on commas. While it ensures that I do not store sentence-fragments there seem to be some sentences with multiple, comma-separated glosses, between which I cannot distinguish. Thus i.e. the gloss "in the flowing sea, (lit.) *in sea-streams" keeps the mark while it had been split off if the two glosses would have been separated. I'll keep it like this though as my form anyway won't be intended to search for phrases and I prefer this solution over gloss-fragments.<br><br>Then as you see in the picture my program marks the source "PEE/17.35" as not resolvable. I guess I should add this to the excpetional source formats where I already have types "MS/01.04" and "Plotz/11.2".<br><br>Furthermore I am now checking all verb-glosses whether they start with "to ", and if not I add that. So far I have not added it to <ref>'s glosses.<br><br>Also I now added the relations to the constructed languages.<br><br>With that I have worked off all the changes I wanted to do and I'll be porting the data to the database again today (gonna take a while...) So probably tomorrow I'll make some more queries to check on the consistency of the data and maybe point out some more things that may be of interest for you.<br></div>
