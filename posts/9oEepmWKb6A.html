        <div class="content">Yet another conflux of words, this time “parent/child, grandparent/grandchild, boy/girl and baby”. These are probably the last for a while<br><br>On the Quenya side, we have Q. <i>nostari</i> “parents” from LotR, so we really have no choice but to use <i>nostar</i> for “parent”. We also have MQ. “male and female parents” <i>ontare/ontaro</i> from the Etymologies, which may also remain legitimate, as well as N. <i>odhron/odhril</i>. There doesn’t seem to be a gender-neutral word for “parent” in Sindarin/Noldorin, but maybe <i>odhron</i> can be used for that purpose. All of these words are from derived the invertible root NŌ/ONO “to beget”.<br><br>For child we have Q. <i>hína</i> and S. <i>hên</i>, both from KHIN. There aren’t any real alternatives on the Sindarin side, but for Quenya we also have Q. <i>onna</i> from NŌ/ONO and MQ. <i>selda</i> from SEL. I personally would avoid both of these: Q. <i>onna</i> seems to mean “begotten thing”, which doesn’t feel right to me, where as <i>selda</i> “child” conflicts with <i>selde</i> “daughter” (but see “boy” below).<br><br>For grandparents we only have early words. On the Quenya side we have EQ. <i>haru/haruni</i> for “grandfather, grandmother” from the 1910s. Their etymology is unclear, but phonetically they are compatible with later Quenya and they don’t conflict with other words, so using them should be fine. We also have G. <i>dâd/mam,</i> for “grandfather, grandmother”. These could plausibly be derived from the roots AT(AR) and AM for “father/mother”, perhaps via reduplication.<br><br>For “grandchild”, in Quenya we have only MQ. <i>indyo</i> “grandchild, descendent” from the Etymologies. The only alternative is the very early use of <i>yondo</i> as “grandson” instead of “son”, which would be too confusing. The cognate for MQ. <i>indyo</i> appears only as ON. <i>ango</i>, which would become (unattested) N./S. *<i>ang</i>. Since this is also the Sindarin/Noldorin word for “iron”, it is clearly unsuitable, which is probably why Tolkien didn’t use it. That leaves us only with very early Gnomish <i>sion/siel</i> “grandson/granddaughter”. These might be connected to the patronymic suffixes <i>-ion</i> and <i>-iel</i>, though the significance of the initial <i>s</i> is unclear.<br><br>There are a couple choices for “girl”. There is Q. <i>nette</i> and S. <i>neth</i> from the same root NETH as the words for “sister”. We also have Q. <i>wende</i> and S. <i>gwend</i> “maiden” from the root WEN(ED). I’d use both, with <i>nette/neth</i> for young girls and <i>wende/gwend</i> for older but unmarried girls. It seems that <i>seldē</i> may have archaically meant “young girl”, but I would use it’s derivatives <i>selde/sell</i> exclusively for “daughter”. There is also N. <i>dess</i> for “young woman”, but Tolkien said it fell out of use and marked it as archaic.<br><br>Finding a word for “boy” is surprisingly hard. On the Sindarin/Gnomish/Noldorin side we have only G. <i>nogin</i> “boy, lad, urchin” from the 1910s with no clear etymology, as well as deleted <i>gontha</i> “boy” that may be a cognate of EQ. <i>yondo</i> (in Gnomish, initial <i>y</i> usually became <i>g</i>). Both are hard to fit into a coherent Sindarin paradigm.<br><br>On the Quenya side, we have MQ. <i>seldo</i> “(male) child”, but that is problematic for the same reason as <i>selda</i> above. All of primitive <i>seldō, seldā, seldē</i> would produce <i>sell</i> in Noldorin/Sindarin. In a couple places in his later writing, though, Tolkien indicated primitive <i>yondō</i> and Q. <i>yondo</i> may mean “boy” as well as “son” (VT47/26-27; PE17/190). Although S. <i>ion</i> was never glossed this way, it might be possible to use it for “boy” as well.<br><br>One possible scenario is that the root SEL may have originally meant “child”, with male, female and neuter variants, but the female variant early on became used as “daughter”. In Quenya, the neuter variant <i>selda</i> fell out of use and was replaced by Q. <i>hína</i> “child” but perhaps <i>seldo</i> “male child” = “boy” survived, while in Sindarin the only survival was S. <i>sell</i> “daughter”. Similarly, if primitive <i>yondō</i> originally meant both “son” and “boy”, and perhaps it retained both meanings in S. <i>ion</i>, but in Quenya came to mean primarily “son” with <i>seldo</i> being used mostly for “boy”.<br><br>Finally, for “baby”, on the Sindarin side we have only S. <i>gwinig</i>, a diminutive form derived from WIN “young”. We have several Quenya words for “baby” derived from the same root, <i>wine, win(i)ce, winimo</i>, but they are all marked archaic. A better choice might be <i>hinye</i> “baby”, which seems to be a diminutive derived from KHIN “child”.<br><br>The net result is:<br><br>“parent”: Q. <i>nostar</i> (or MQ. <i>ontaro/ontare</i>), S. [N.] <i>odhron</i> (feminine <i>odhril</i>)<br>“child”: Q. <i>hína</i>, S. <i>hên</i><br>“grandfather/grandmother”: Q. [EQ.] <i>haru/haruni</i>, S. [G.] <i>dâd/mam</i><br>“grandchild”: Q. [MQ.] <i>indyo</i> (feminine <i>indye</i>?), S. [G.] <i>sion/siel</i> (male and female)<br>“girl/maiden”: Q. <i>nette/wende</i>, S. <i>neth/gwend</i><br>“boy”: Q. <i>seldo</i> (and perhaps <i>yondo</i>), S. <i>ion</i> (the same word as “son”)<br>“baby”: Q. <i>hinye</i>, S. <i>gwinig</i><br><br>For other family-words, we have only early forms of dubious etymologies, and I’m not ready to tackle them yet.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lokyt-l">Lokyt L.</a> Hmm. This may be an error in Eldamo. I have scanned copies of most of the PE issues on my computer but not VT, so I sometimes get sloppy about double checking against original sources when it is VT. <br><br>I don’t remember why I marked those archaic in Eldamo. It may simply be that they start with “w” rather than “v”. I will take another look this weekend.</div>

        <div class="content">I found the reference. Tolkien did indicate all of these forms were archaic. On VT48/6, Note 5, he says “Pengoloð gives these in archaic Quenya form before the change of <i>w</i> (in most situations to <i>v</i>)”. So the marker † in Eldamo is correct.<br><br>However, just because the form <i>winimo</i> itself is archaic doesn’t mean the word was abandoned, so my original reasoning for preferring <i>hinye</i> over <i>wine/winimo/win(i)ce</i> isn’t sound. More likely these became <i>vine/vinimo/vin(i)ce</i> in Exhilic Quenya. So any of those might be a better choice for “baby” than <i>hinye</i>.<br><br>I am becoming less fond of <i>hinye</i> the more I think about it. I am leaning towards <i>vinimo</i> or perhaps <i>vince</i> at the moment.</div>

        <div class="content">I think onna is still a useful word in the sense of "offspring (not necessarily of humans)".<br>Incidentally, the fact the boy/son and girl/daughter are the same words is not unheard of; in Hungarian, it is exactly the case; when there is a possessive suffix on boy or girl, it is understood to mean son or daughter.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> Yep, what Tolkien says in that note is that Pengolodh for some reason noted the words down with archaic <i>w-</i> instead of classic <i>v-</i>; not that the words are archaic altogether.</div>
