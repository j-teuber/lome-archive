        </h3>
        <div class="content">Hello, lovely people.<br>Earlier this year, +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> asked if you could help me out with a conundrum I had in finding a suitable name for my English longbow (see here: <a class="int-link" href="/lome-archive/redict.html?q=3kqz4zQNzTc">https://plus.google.com/+TamasFerencz/posts/3kqz4zQNzTc</a>).<br><br>I hope nobody minds, but I'd like to ask the same favour again. If anyone thinks this is in any way inappropriate, please let me know and I'll remove the post.<br><br>I've done some minor looking into Sindarin over the last nine months or so, but not enough so as to say I've really 'progressed'.  As a certain fat innkeeper might say, <i>one thing drives out another.</i><br><br>This new bow is one that I've made myself. And before anyone asks, the answer is <i>Yes. It's bent near the top, and it's supposed to be!</i> <br><br><strong>[Begin brief background]</strong><br>I went on a 4-day bow-making workshop, over the course of which I made this bow from a single piece of yew wood. The instructor began by showing us a beautifully finished bow he'd made on his previous course. It too had a beautiful wave in the limb (though I think in that case it may have been the lower limb). I thought it was a wonderfully unique-looking bow.<br><br>So, when I was selecting my raw wooden stave from which to start carving my bow, I looked for one which had some sort of "character" of its own. Somewhat ironically (since it was now somewhat less unique) I saw a stave with a bend in it and immediately grabbed it.<br><strong>[/background]</strong><br><br>Which is all a long-ish way of saying that the bend is a feature, and indeed it's my favourite part of the bow. So if possible, I think it might be nice to have the feature called out in the name.  Is there a suitable word in S. or Q. which means "bend" or "curve" which could be adapted into a name?<br><br>If it helps, this bow was a <strong>bugger</strong> to carve ... in no small part due to the wave (irony rears its cruel head yet again). It simply didn't want to "drop its weight', no matter how much wood I carved off of it over the first 2.5 days. Only on the afternoon of the 3rd day did it finally begin to bend. I therefore think, that due to the difficult, stubborn nature of the bow, that it may well be masculine. ;-)<br><br>Any thoughts?</div>

        <div class="content">Ah, I see.  I thought it was the same bow.  My mistake.<br><br>I still don't know how to morph words, so I am sure the following will all be slightly wrong, if not more (hoping someone can correct me).<br><br><i>Cún</i> already means "bowed", as in "shape of a bow".  Maybe <i>Cúniraeg</i>, or even <i>Tawamaruhoeg</i> (crooked red wood).  Difficult to make, difficult to pronounce.</div>

        <div class="content">On second thought, forget Raengún - a name of a bow probably wouldn't contain the word 'bow', would it? If you gave it a name in English, what would it be? Probably a kenning of some sort? Crooked Death? Gnarled Slayer? Killer Twang?</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#jeremiah-burns">Jeremiah Burns</a><br>no, dir- and gor- are both prefixes meaning 'difficult, laborious'. *cad- is a reconstructed verb 'to shape, carve', cf. the attested verb <i>echad-</i> 'shape out, form', literally <i>et-</i> 'out' + <i>cad-</i>; see <i>Im Narvi hain echant</i><br>If it were to be a proper grammatical form it should probably be something like <i>*dirchaded</i> 'difficult shaping' (a gerund, basically) or <i>*dirchadui</i> 'difficultly shaped' (adjectival form); but I think names follow a bit different rule and are often distorted, contracted over time.</div>
