        <div class="content">This is a very difficult question.<br><br>I think the real challenge is the nature of the Tolkienic Linguistic Community. I think many people in the community (myself included) would dearly lovely to see practical, spoken Elvish (either Sindarin or Quenya) become a reality. In order to meet this goal, many of them dive into the available scholarship and discover its immense complexity.<br><br>Those that delve into the study of Elvish discover the rigorous standards to which Tolkien adhered: namely that the language not only be functional, but that it has a rich (albeit fictional) linguistic history. To honor Tolkien's memory, they come to desire that their own work adhere to that same standard.<br><br>Furthermore, to engage with the rest of the community, they must adhere to an even more rigorous standard, namely consistency with the material that Tolkien wrote, which is both incomplete and filled with contradictions.<br><br>At this point it is easy to become bogged down with minutia. It is possible to spend a lot of time learning about the inner workings and evolution of Tolkien's language without advance much (if at all) in the direction of a practical spoken Elvish.<br><br>The end result is that most of those who are most knowledgeable about Tolkien's languages are burdened with such (self-imposed) constraints on extending the language that it becomes difficult to do so, much less get any kind of communal agreement on those extensions.<br><br>This is something I've thought a great deal about and I don't see an easy way out of this puzzle.<br><br>To be honest, I think the only way to advance quickly would be for someone to simply ignore Tolkienic scholarship (except maybe for some basic rules on phonotactics) and just crank out a bunch of additions to the language. You could then end up with a working language that resembles Quenya or Sindarin in a reasonable amount of time, but unfortunately the likelihood of the community accepting it would be very small.</div>

        <div class="content">I completely agree with +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a>. More than that, we (since I also have been thinking about spoken Quenya for a long time) are bound and restricted by various copyright issues: what happens if I write a line in Tengwar in my book and then publish it? What happens if I write such a line on my t-shirt? What happens if someone of us invents (or deduces) a word that would accidentally coincide with such a word in still unpublished Tolkienian corpus? This is an extremely important problem to deal with, IMO.</div>

        <div class="content">This was my goal with Sindarin all from when I first tried to learn it. And since a few years, it is also indeed my goal for Quenya. I would be happy to participate in a activity described by Arellond, though I never thought about point 4. and 5. Should i complain over my stupid colleges at work? Or describe machinery and computer programmes? Talk about recent politics? I'm certainly okay with that, but I didn't think of using Quenya for it. One thing I've realized that at least Sndarin is fit for, is discussing relationships. <br><br>One method I've seen to expand the vocabulary (though I think the project died out quietly) is to generate Common Eldarin roots. One programmes a computer to analyze the sound-combinations occuring in the CE words, then generating roots that have such combinations, and then choosing the better ones for usage, and assign a meaning to them, and thereafter letting the roots undergo the process of sound-changes seen in Q (or S) development. If we think that we need a large amount of new words (I think we do) and we are keen on having the new words fit together with the attested words (we definitely are), then this might be an option. <br><br>As long as we avoid certain names for commercial purposes, I don't think anyone can sue us for speaking a language. </div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> First: it's only a play with different possibilities. I do not aim a generating new roots, especially since there are still unpublished words. But further, we, also you, are already creating new words, according to the rules of compatibility with attested stuff and a typical phonology. <br><br>If Quenya ever become a living language, it we will see completely new words (or loan words from non-Arda sources) enter the vocabulary, because that is what happens to living languages. To avoid such, we need to keep Quenya a dead language. </div>

In a recent discussion we had, we were faced with the inconsistency of Sindarin Phonetics, and consequently, the words made with those phonetic rules. By <i>made</i>, I'm not just talking about our reconstructions.<br><br>The order, and sometimes the definition of these rules result in words which cannot coexist, at least in the same dialect.

        <div class="content">I've been lurking in this group for a while, wondering about exactly these questions. Hello, everyone :)<br><br>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#hjalmar-holm">Hjalmar Holm</a> Re: using a computer program to simulate sound change--I've started writing a program that attempts to do that (<a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/benchristel/sindarin/tree/master/changes">https://github.com/benchristel/sindarin/tree/master/changes</a>). The problem with this method is that it forces a level of consistency to which Tolkien himself appears not to have adhered. In many cases it's not clear how to generalize the attested sound changes. We even see attested sound changes that appear to be contradictory, or which are at least inconsistently applied. So the sequence of sound changes that get us from PQ to Sindarin or Quenya is far from fixed. To do any sort of reconstruction, we need to pare down the set of "plausible" reconstructed forms to the ones we actually intend to use—and here only our personal aesthetic senses can guide us.<br><br>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> warns against the possibility of developing multiple "dialects" of neo-Elvish with limited acceptance within the wider community. I share his concerns, and I wonder if we couldn't start by clearly identifying the core "features" that need to be part of <i>any</i> neo-Sindarin or neo-Quenya for it to be acceptable. These would probably be mainly vocabulary and attested forms from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (since LotR is really the only source published by Tolkien during his lifetime). We would probably also want to generalize at least a few grammatical and phonological rules from LotR and other sources. It seems inevitable to me that different communities will produce different dialects of neo-Elvish, and a shared "core grammar" would help mitigate the problem of divergence and also inform new students about which parts of the language are well-attested.<br><br>I also think our reconstruction methods should be informed by our goals for the languages. I love the Elvish languages for their beauty, not their utility, and I think reconstruction efforts should be directed by aesthetics and not focus as much on making an "Elf-speranto". I share Hostetter's sensitivity to the clumsiness of many reconstructions (see <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.elvish.org/articles/EASIS.pdf">http://www.elvish.org/articles/EASIS.pdf</a>), but I'd like to believe that with some ingenuity we could fix such problems.<br><br>I have mixed feelings about strict adherence to Tolkien canon. I began studying Elvish languages in part because I wanted to understand Tolkien's techniques for producing beautiful poems and names, in part because I wanted to build a kind of continuity between Arda and the primary world. However, I didn't start learning from primary sources. My first exposure to Elvish was Salo's neo-Sindarin, and without that exposure I might never have read <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> at all. And this is a source of some distress: while I dearly want an authentic, true-to-Tolkien version of Elvish, am still enamored of many of Salo's coinages, leaps of faith, and false conclusions. Like Hostetter, I am wary of the <i>methods</i> of neo-Elvish, but unlike him I have great affection for (some of) the results of those methods.</div>
