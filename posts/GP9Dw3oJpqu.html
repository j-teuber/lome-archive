        <div class="content">Irrealis was something that my Syntax professor was big on. The future tense and hypothetical statements... anything that isn't real when the statement is made.  For example "who ought to be called Fullwise" isn't actually talking about the future, it's talking about something that ought to happen, a state that's not factual, because he isn't called Fullwise already. So, I think the <s>tha on "esta</s>" there is marking something that's not true right then.</div>

        <div class="content">The ending <i>tha</i> is clearly future in <i>Aragorn [...] anglennatha i Varanduiniant</i> 'Aragorn [...] will approach the Baranduin bridge'. The particle <i>aen</i> then could either be a pronoun 'they' or mark modality. Comparing with Q. <i>ai-</i> and noticing that there are no pronouns similar to <i>aen</i> anywhere, the modality interpretation seems very likely.<br><br>The analysis in VT50 interprets <i>en</i> as a corresponding indicative marker, but I have a hard time buying that:<br>- The word order in <i>estathar aen</i> and <i>en estar</i> is different.<br>- Indicative is so common that it doesn't require any explicit marker at all. I don't know of any natural language that has one.<br>- We have a very similar example in Quenya: <i>quetir en</i> 'they still say' (PE17:167) and S. <i>eno</i> *'still' on the same page, so why couldn't <i>en</i> just mean *'still, also'? Hence <i>eithro en estar</i> *'otherwise also they-call'.</div>
