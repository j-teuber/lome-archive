        <div class="content">One thing that we need to improve as a community is our abilities to add Tengwar, Sarati, and Cirth transcriptions to our websites. It's not possible on social media websites, we can accept that, but on our own websites it's possible. Some of us have the knowledge and ability to do it, but most of us are luddites. We need to set up really simple ways to do this that non-code-literate folks can use.<br><br>This means:<br>1. Step by step instructions.<br>2. Setting up remote hosting for the fonts for those who can't just install it on their own servers.<br>3. Building plugins for the more popular website building tools like WordPress.</div>

        <div class="content">Also, in my opinion, the existing popular Tengwar typefaces are excellent works, but there is still room for a Tengwar typeface that scales well, and retains legibility and readability even at smaller sizes typically used in body text. You know, the Verdana of Tengwar. This is something that has interested me for a long time now, and I even started playing around in FontForge, but I simply lack the graphic skills to pull it off.</div>

        <div class="content">Okay here's a quick tutorial for how to embed custom fonts the easiest way, which also should work on pretty much any CMS there is:<br><br>* Step 1: Add an "HTML" or "Custom Widget" or similar element using the website builder of your CMS (in my case I use the Elementor plugin for Wordpress).<br>* Step 2: Add the following code:<br><br><style><br>    @font-face {<br>    font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar';<br>    src: url('http://{url to font}/tengwar-annatar.ttf') <br>    format('truetype');<br>    }<br>    .tng-an {<br>        font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar';<br>    }<br></style><br><p class="tng-an">`Cj¸# Á</p> <br><br>This will insert a paragraph that says "Alla!" in Tengwar. All elements on the page you embed this code and have [class="tng-an"] on them will be displayed as Tengwar.<br><br>In my editor this would look like this:<br><a class="ext-link" href="https://plus.google.com/photos/102182311550234423672/albums/6500490843348106993/6500490843677116162">https://plus.google.com/photos/...</a></div>

        <span class="time">Dec 17, 2017 (13:33)</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="content">Now you can also apply Tengwar to existing elements without having to write them as code, however the procedure there differs between different CMS and types of elements and exact needs.<br><br>Simple things can be to i.e. change all second headings (<h2>-Tags) on the page to Tengwar, for this write in the HTML-element inside the <style> tag:<br><br>h2 {<br>    font-family: 'Tengwar-Annatar'<br>}<br><br>I also tried changing up a form so that when you input text into only one specific field it's displayed as Tengwar. For that, in the case of Wordpress + Elementor, you need to go to the Form's definition and add the "tng-an" class to the required form field:<br><a class="ext-link" href="https://plus.google.com/photos/102182311550234423672/albums/6500493081438556673/6500493084430956994">https://plus.google.com/photos/...</a></div>

        <span class="time">Dec 17, 2017 (13:37)</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="content">Then the HTML-element needs to be changed as well. As we don't want to target the Label (the form field's description) but the <textarea> element that's inside we use the CSS selector ".tng-an textarea", which means "all <textarea> tags within another tag that has the class 'tng-an' ". Furthermore, to still have the paragraph from before working we need to add another selector "p.tng-an", which means "all <p> tags with the .tng-an class".<br><br>The new code looks like this:<br><br><style><br>    @font-face {<br>    font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar';<br>    src: url('http://{url to font}/tengwar-annatar.ttf') <br>    format('truetype');<br>    }<br>    p.tng-an, .tng-an textarea {<br>        font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar';<br>    }<br></style><br><p class="tng-an">`Cj¸# Á</p> <br></div>

        <div class="content">And then hopefully the page looks like this:<br><a class="ext-link" href="https://plus.google.com/photos/102182311550234423672/albums/6500494221716143729/6500494222563711522">https://plus.google.com/photos/...</a></div>

        <div class="content">Sorry for the spam, but can only add one picture per comment ;)<br><br>So, as you see with the form example, many things are possible, but depending on what you want the way to achieve it may be very different. So writing a tutorial that's working for many situations and CMS may be difficult. Best you describe concretely what exactly you want and then I may be able to tell you what to do to achieve it.<br><br>I censored the URL to the font for now, it leads to my own WIP page, that's for two reasons:<br>- I would be happy to host the fonts for everyone making websites out there, but I want to respect the terms put up by the font creators, and these usually do not allow sharing the fonts without the documentation / readme files or for commercial use; and i could not control whether the fonts hosted by me would be used commercially or not.<br>- The URL is temporary only, as soon as the new page replaces the old one the URL will change again (and all external implementations of the fonts will break)</div>

        <div class="content">We have used two different methods over on <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.sindarin.de/tolkienforum/">http://www.sindarin.de/tolkienforum/</a> :<br><br>1. The font encodes the tengwar in the PUA of Unicode. This has the benefit that it cannot possible clash with other characters. Therefore, the tengwar can be added globally to the entire site without the need of defining any extra classes or tags. All you need to do is adding the following line to the CSS:<br><br>  * {font-family: FreeMonoTengwar, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, sans-serif !important;}<br><br>2. The tengwar font has been added within the CSS file itself, in base64 encoding. The benefit (and only reason why you would want to do this) is that you need not uploading any separate files or worry about hosting the font. The drawback is that the CSS file becomes considerably larger (comparable to a medium-sized picture). Here is the link to the stylesheet that includes the font:<br><br><a class="ext-link" href="http://www.sindarin.de/tolkienforum/styles/subsilver2/theme/stylesheet.css">http://www.sindarin.de/tolkienforum/styles/subsilver2/theme/stylesheet.css</a><br><a class="ext-link" href="http://www.sindarin.de/tolkienforum/search.php?search_id=newposts">sindarin.de - Mellyn Lammath • Anmelden</a></div>

However some offer the possibility to modify global CSS or access a page's header and similar.</div>
