        <div class="content">Has anyone ever produced a satisfactory derivation for Q <i>Vása</i> "the Consumer"? It's been bugging me so I've looked throughout some of the older material, but am not coming up with anything. Perhaps a root √(g)wath, √(g)was (if no rhotacism), √bath ... but we already have √(g)wath linked with shadow instead.<br><br>My only other idea is if somehow √GAS "yawn, gape" from Etym. had a variant √GWAS that could be linked with "consume" in the sense of materials being sucked into the gaping hole. However, √GAS may have been obsoleted by √YAG anyway.<br><br>Does anyone have any better ideas? <i>Naira</i> seems to have I-infixion and is more easy to understand, but <i>Vása</i> is giving me a headache.</div>

        <div class="content">I could add even more to the confusion: GL on the one hand has <i>Clui</i> 'properly the juices and the fruit of Noon, but used for "Sun", Aur, and for sunny warmth' and on the other hand <i>gwâs</i> 'juice' with the Qenya cognate <i>vasa</i>.<br>I could understand how 'juice of Laurelin's fruit' could be used for the sun's rays and heat, but <i>clui</i> seems to derive from the concept of 'warm(th)' directly (see <i>cluim, cluimri</i>)...<br><br>And none of it is related to 'consume' - which I think is meant along the lines of 'singe, scorch, burn/dry up' in this context.. There are certainly plenty of roots related to warmth, hotness and burning in the Lexicons, so perhaps Tolkien decided to make one up on the fly (or reinterpret <i>vasa</i>) without noting it down separately?</div>

        <div class="content">Thanks Roman. I think you're right about 'singe, scorch, burn/dry up' in this sense.<br>One possibility might be if √mbas "bake" had a related root √bas "burn (through), consume," but that's entirely speculation.<br><br>Tolkien did indeed like reusing old forms but reinterpreting their meaning; for example he had words related to "cold, chill, winter" from √DYEL, producing Gn. words in Gel-, Del-, etc. But later in the 20s he re-appropriated the root to make Delimorgoth > Delu-morgoth, retaining the derivation but changing the root's meaning to "terrible" (compare it in Etym.)<br><br>Like you said, perhaps Tolkien carried over that old word but changed its meaning.</div>

        <div class="content">I find both ideas really interesting, but there doesn't seem to be anything resembling later √(g)wath in the Lexicons..<br>Regarding *√bas, in the Pater Noster Sindarin translation Tolkien actually starts with <i>i v</i> before changing it to <i>i mbas</i>.

        <div class="content">Hmm, those are interesting solutions. As for √wath, it's found in VT42:9-10 as √wath, √wathar (late '60s) in discussion of Gwathló and Gwathir, as well as Gwathuirim, and √WATH earlier in 30s Etym. - and perhaps in Nebrachar's <i>avosaith</i> (according to Fauskanger's analysis).</div>

        <div class="content">My next irritation regards <i>Cermië</i> / <i>Cerveth</i> "July" - I'm not sure about its derivation or meaning. Is it from √KER (meaning what?) and containing <i>-mie</i> (PE17:68) and related <i>-veth</i>, or is the root a  <i>talat</i> or <i>kalta</i> stem like √KEREM or √KERÉM, with the commonly-found <i>-ie</i> and <i>-eth</i>?<br><br>If the latter, I have no clue what the intended meaning could be. The former ?might? have some connection with √KWER "revolve" and √KYER "pray, *turn to God," but I'm not sure how such a meaning could be connected to the month of July.</div>

        <div class="content">Comparing the Sindarin and Quenya forms, it should be something like *√KEREM- (with an unattested meaning) rather than a compound.<br><br>One may get an idea what it could mean from the sequence of month names, freely translated as:<br><i>new warmth/sun - wet - windy - sprouting - blossoming - warm/sunny - ??? - hot - harvest - fading warmth/sun - misty - cold</i><br>There is really no word between 'warm' and 'hot', so one can eliminate a reference to temperature, I think. My deep gut feeling is that it means something like 'ripening' or 'time of fruits'.<br>In natural languages, months are often named after a particular plant which blossoms during that time or is harvested, or an animal which comes out; but the Elvish nomenclature seems to be rather generic. I don't have the sources at hand right now, but one should also cross-check with the early names in PM.<br><br>A connection with 'revolve, turn' may be that the sun 'turns away' after the solstice; unfortunately √KWER- doesn't quite fit phonologically..</div>

        <div class="content">Right - my suggestion wasn't that they could be from √KWER, but rather from an unattested root *√KER that is connected with √KYER and √KWER, i.e. the Interconnexion of Bases in PE18, cp. √KEL / √KYEL / √KWEL.

        <div class="content">I'm just back from Omentielva Enquea where Betrand gave an interesting talk on the month names. Apparently Tolkien has largely adapted them from the French Republican Calendar (<a class="ext-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar</a>). <i>Cermie</i> would correspond to <i>Messidor</i>, related to 'harvest', so *KEREM- might be somehow related to KIR-, meaning 'cutting, reaping'.<br>In any case, you can look forward to a very thorough analysis and comparison with natural languages in Arda Philology 6!</div>

Since the next one will be in California, I may finally be able to afford the airfare, though participants will be different.<br><br>Incidentally, I also discovered a few hours ago that Jim Allan came to the same conclusion about the French Republican Calendar back in his 1978 <i>Introduction to Elvish</i>, which I don't have a copy of. I'll have to get one - I'll enjoy reading both of their differing analyses, especially now that we know more about Tolkien's languages than was the case back then.</div>
