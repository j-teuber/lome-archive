        <div class="content">Some belated comments (I was away for a while):<br><br>1. I don't think <i>-rim</i> has to become <i>-lim</i> after <i>l</i> since we have <i>lr</i> attested in <i>balrog, talraph</i>.<br>2. The cluster <i>str</i> doesn't necessarily change to <i>thr</i>, cf. <i>mistrad, ostrad</i> (the former is misread in Etym).<br>3. Where does the dual <i>-id</i> come from? As far as I'm aware, <i>-id</i> only appears in <i>nœgid</i> which may simply be a plural of <i>noged</i> 'petty dwarf' or a sideform (cf. diminutive  _-eg/ig_ in <i>atheg, emig</i>).</div>

        <div class="content">Thanks Roman! It took me a while to get back here. School has started for me, yet again. Hopefully this is my last year as a college student!<br><br>1. What I think happened was that there was <i>rim</i>, and <i>-li</i> (like in Quenya). They combined, and we get words like <i>gódhellim</i> (WJ/364)<br>2. Good catch! Though... later on it would have become more and more difficult to tell the difference between -ss, -s, and -st, so they'd start to blend together.<br>3. Matt answered that question, but I add: it appears to have been a <i>-t</i> first. Thus <i>hent</i>, for "a pair of eyes". Also, I should probably include the diminutive forms <i>-od</i> and <i>-ed</i> in the section I made for diminutive suffixes.</div>

        <div class="content">1. Ah yes, of course!<br>2. Only at the end of a word, though.<br>3. Well, these forms are verbal endings where <s><i>i</i></s> is the thematic vowel of the conjugation. <br><br>The thing is, most words originally ended with a vowel to which the dual <s><i>t</i></s> could be attached. For example, <i>talf</i> is from <i>*talmā</i>, with the dual presumably being <i>*talmā-t(a)</i>, leading to <i>*talvad</i>. This is probably how we get <i>galadhad</i>, via <i>galadā+t(a)</i>. (Actually, one might have expected <i>*galadhod</i> because of the long <i>ā</i>, so it must have shortened for some reason - either this was the original declension pattern, or it happened later by analogy to the shortened singular <i>*galaða</i>).<br><i>Hent</i> in Etym belongs to <i>hên, hîn</i> which ended in <i>-n</i> (hence the long vowel, a replaced earlier variant is <i>henn, hinn < *khendē</i>) and could receive <i>-t</i> as an ending directly, but I'd say one needs to go word by word and see whether this is applicable.</div>
