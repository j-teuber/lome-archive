        <div class="content">Well, I think a bit of irony easily handles that :)<br><br>There's also something else that could be a problem: a lack of negative markedness. What you need (if I understand correctly) is an adjective expressing "(someone) feeling/acting noble and lofty in spite of not actually being like that", "unduly proud" – whereas Q. <i>arata</i>, S. <i>raud</i> etc. are rather "(someone) REALLY being noble and lofty", "acting in a DULY exalted way".<br>But, again, irony is irony... :)</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lokyt-l">Lokyt L.</a> Well, “stiff-necked” mostly just means “stubborn” in English as well. Given the extra gloss, it seems possible that S. <i>tarlang</i> has an additional connotation, though I doubt it could be used for “proud” in a positive sense (“I am proud of what you did”).<br><br>There is another English expression of “having one’s nose in the air” which means “haughty”, so perhaps the Sindarin expression is similar to that?<br><br>Interestingly, one of the glosses for the root TOL is “raise the head” (VT47/28), and there is an English expression “hold your head high” for being justifiably proud, so perhaps TOL could be used to craft a neologism for the other (good) sense of “proud”.<br><br>There is also early Noldorin <i>blodren</i> “arrogant”, so perhaps something could be done with that.</div>

        <div class="content">Yet another take is a neologism in Helge Fauskanger's Bible translation. Below is an except from the paper that he wrote early on into the project:<br><br>A special case is the word <i>*valatë</i> “pride” (occurring once, 1 John 2:16). The only published word for “pride” seems to be <i>blaud</i> from an early version of Noldorin (PE13:160). I treated the word as if it were Sindarin (it certainly fits its style well enough, as does the derived adjective <i>blodren</i> “arrogant”). Thus I referred <i>blaud</i> to primitive <i>*b(a)lātē</i> (opting for <i>​-​ē</i> as the lost final vowel because this is a common abstract ending). This in turn allows the derivation of <i>*valatë</i> as the – hypothetical! – Quenya cognate. We can assume <i>*BALAT​-​</i> as an extended form of the root <i>BAL​-​</i> having to do with power (LR:350), as if words for “pride” come from an original concept of “lordliness”. The fact that <i>BAL</i> yields the word <i>Vala</i> does not mean that it cannot have negative connotations; it also provides the initial element of <i>Balrog</i> “power-demon”, Q <i>Valarauco</i>!<br><br>Such words occurred many more times as he continued his translation. He sometimes used <i>*valatie</i> instead of <i>*valate</i> and adjectival forms <i>*valatea, *valata</i> 'pride'.</div>
