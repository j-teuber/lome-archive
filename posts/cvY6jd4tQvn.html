        <div class="content">A conceptual question.<br><br>We know that in Q adjectives can act as nouns (A Vanimar etc.). Would you agree that the same concept could be true for adjectival participles, in particular for future imperfect participles?<br>In my native Hungarian the future imperfect participle ("is to/bound to do/happen") exists (although it is relatively rare compared to the present imperfect participle which is very widely used in both adjectival and nominal roles) and is the basis of a lot of nouns. For example<br><i>jövendő</i> "is to come = future"<br><i>teendő</i> "is to be done = task"<br><i>halandó</i> "bound to die = mortal"<br>even <i>beadandó</i> "to be handed in = essay to be written at home and handed in at university"<br>and more.<br><br>If the same concept can apply in Q that would yield another legitimate way to derive words. E.g. <i>*ahtaruvaila</i> "(person) to react = responsible (person)" > <i>*ahtaruvailasse</i> "responsibility".</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> thanks. One thing that would help to mark these forms as nouns would be that most of the time they would be preceded by a definite article: <i>i karuvaila</i> "the task" and could be regarded as an elliptical construct: <i>i karuvaila [nat]</i>, <i>i ahtaruvaila [quén]</i>.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> Syntax like the above doesn't feel natural to me. Use <i>karuvaila</i> for "task" seems to me as awkward as using "future doing thing" for that purpose in English.<br><br>Where English uses adjectives as nouns, they are frequently collective, as in "the wicked will punished", with the understanding that "wicked" is plural. I can see Quenya using a construct like <i>i hrúar</i> in a similar way, clearly distinguishable for adjectival use because it has a noun plural instead of an adjective plural.<br><br>The handful of examples of Quenya adjectives-as-nouns seem to follow this pattern. For example, <i>alómear</i> "the voiceless" for voiceless consonants.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ицхак-пензев">Ицхак Пензев</a> yes, it is good to have so many different forms - in this respect PE22 is a veritable treasure trove and boon.<br>Somehow I feel that creating neologisms using attested and productive formative suffixes (-ta, -inqua, -ite, -ima, -ula etc. etc.) is a more natural way of getting results than for instance trying to make cognates. It is in keeping with the agglutinative features of the language to the extent that - tome at least - they don't even feel like neologisms, they are a natural part of conjugation.</div>

        <div class="content">If it's any help, Latin (one of the languages Tolkien drew his inspiration from) does use future participles in a noun syntactic role quite widely. After all, the famous "Addenda et Corrigenda" literally translates as "(those) to be added and (those) to be corrected".<br>However, both active and passive future participle in Latin are  modally potential (they express an <i>intention</i>, not a <i>statement</i>) and the same seems to be the case in Hungarian as well (or am I wrong?). Quenya future participles, on the other hand, are plainly indicative, are they not?</div>

        <div class="content">In Esperanto, future participles are in the very basic grammar arsenal from the very first day when the Fundamento was published. And yet they aren't popular, because most people don't understand how they can use them, for the very concept seems pretty foreign to Indo-European mind. But some of set phrases give good precedents, like <i>daŭrigota</i> "[bound] to be continued" in the end of a film or publication.</div>
