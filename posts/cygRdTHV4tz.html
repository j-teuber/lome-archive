        </h3>
        <div class="content">Here is another exploration of Eldarin words, this time “father/mother, son/daughter, sister/brother”<br><br>“Father” is dead easy. The words Q. <i>atar</i>, S. <i>adar</i> from the root ATAR were established early and Tolkien used them pretty consistently. “Mother” is trickier. Tolkien established AM as the root for “mother” very early on the Quenya side, but its use on the Sindarin/Noldorin/Gnomish side is inconsistent. Probably the best attested Quenya word for “mother” is <i>amil(le)</i>, appearing in the Etymologies from the 1930s, Tolkien’s translations of Catholic prayers from the 1950s and isolated words like <i>amilesse</i> “mother name”. However, it’s only clear cognate is N. <i>emil</i> from the Etymologies, and that word is marked as archaic.<br><br>The whole question of “mother” is further complicated by Tolkien’s writing on “Eldarin Hands and Fingers” from the late 1960s (VT47-48) where he revisited a lot of family words as the basis for finger names. In those texts he listed both AM and EM as roots for “mother”, and seems to have preferred EM over AM. The best illustration of this change was his revision of <i>amya</i> “mommy” (original meaning “my mother”) to <i>emya</i> as a reduction of <i>emil-inya</i>. He also introduced S. <i>emel</i> “mother”, which unlike its Noldorin predecessor, cannot be the result of i-affection and thus must be from EM.<br><br>The problem is that Tolkien mostly listed pet names in these texts (“mummy, mommy”) and did not make clear what he wanted the new Quenya word for “mother” to be. There is Q. <i>emme</i> “mother”, but this is also used as a pet-name, glossed “mummy”. There is Q. <i>emil</i> in the derivation <i>emya</i>, but that would produce S. <i>imil</i>. My best guess would be Q. *<i>emelle</i> as the new form of “mother”, but I think I prefer to stick with better attested <i>amil(le)</i>.<br><br>On the Sindarin side, if we use Q. <i>amil(le)</i> we cannot use S. <i>emel</i>. We might revert to N. <i>emil</i>, but that word is marked archaic. I think it would be better to use N. <i>naneth</i> “mother” from the Etymologies, derived from the Noldorin-only root NAN, and treat N. <i>emil</i> as a poetic-only form.<br><br>For pet names we have Q. <i>atto, atya, tata</i> for “daddy”, and <i>amya</i> and perhaps *<i>amma</i> (instead of <i>emme</i>) for “mummy, mommy”. On the Sindarin side, I’d go with N. <i>ada</i> for “daddy” and N. <i>nana</i> for “mommy”.<br><br>For “son”, again the question is easy. Q. <i>yondo</i>, S. <i>ion</i> are well attested, along with patronymic suffixes Q./S. <i>-ion</i> “son of”. On the other hand, “daughter” is a mess. There a lots of options on the Quenya side (<i>yende, yelde, selde, anel</i>). On the Sindarin side, however, we have N. †_sell_ > <i>iell</i> from the Etymologies of the 1930s, and also S. <i>sell</i> from the King’s Letter from the early 1950s. If we go with S. <i>sell</i>, that points to Q. <i>selde</i>.<br><br>Q. <i>selde</i> and S. <i>sell</i> would point to the patronymic Q. <i>-rel</i> “daughter of”, but this is used in only one name, <i>Tindómerel</i> “Daughter of Twilight” (Quenya equivalent of <i>Tinúviel</i>). The most common feminine patronymic is <i>-iel</i> in both Quenya and Sindarin. I’d use that, perhaps produced by analogy with <i>-ion</i>. Still, <i>-iel</i> is more consistent with the Q./S. <i>yelde/iell</i> for “daughter”, and that might be a viable alternative over Q./S. <i>selde/sell</i>.<br><br>For brother and sister, we have a couple choices. In the aforementioned “Eldarin Hands and Fingers” from the late 1960s, we have “brother” = Q. <i>háno</i> and S. <i>hanar</i> (archaic <i>hawn</i>) from the root KHAN, as well as “sister” = Q. <i>nésa</i> (archaic <i>néþa</i>) and S. <i>nethel</i> (archaic <i>nîth</i>) from the root NETH. This seems to be a complete paradigm in both languages, and I see no reason not to use it.<br><br>In the Etymologies, the root NETH was used for “youth”, but most of those words seem to have moved to the root WIN in Tolkien’s later writing. In place of MQ. <i>nesse</i> and N. <i>nîth</i> “youth”, we can instead use Q. <i>víne</i> and S. <i>gwîn</i>. In place of MQ. <i>nessa</i> and N. <i>neth</i> “young” we can use Q. <i>vinya</i> and S. <i>gwain</i> “young, new”. It seems that in Tolkien’s later writing, NETH could also mean “young girl” (as in Q. <i>nette</i>, S. <i>neth</i>) but I don’t think that conflicts with the sense “sister”. In fact, this S. <i>neth</i> “young girl” could still be an element in N. <i>dineth</i> “bride”, variant form of <i>dîs</i>.<br><br>From the Etymologies we have earlier roots TORON and THEL(ES) for “brother” and “sister”. For this basic sense, I would use later KHAN and NETH, but I might retain TORON and THELES in the more abstract sense of “brotherhood” and “sisterhood”. In this way, I would replace MQ. <i>toron/seler</i> and N. <i>tôr/thêl</i> with later Q. <i>háno/nésa</i> and S. <i>hanar/nethel</i>, but I would retain other derivatives of TORON/THEL(ES) such as MQ. <i>otornasse</i> “brotherhood” and N. <i>gwathel</i> “(sworn) sister, (female) associate”.<br><br>The net result is:<br><br>“father/mother”: Q. <i>atar/amil(le)</i>, S. <i>adar/naneth</i> (or archaic <i>emil</i>)<br>“daddy”: Q. <i>atya, atto, tata</i>, S. <i>ada</i><br>“mommy”: Q. <i>amya, *amma</i>, S. <i>nana</i><br>“son/daughter”: Q. <i>yondo/selde</i>, S. <i>ion/sell</i><br>“son of/daughter of”: <i>-ion</i> and <i>-iel</i> in both languages<br>“brother/sister”: Q. <i>háno/nésa</i>, S. <i>hanar/nethel</i> (archaic <i>hawn/nîth</i>)<br><br>The roots for “father/mother” are AT(AR) and AM, but in Sindarin “mother” was replaced by NAN.<br><br>The roots for “son/daughter” are YON(DO) and SEL(DE) but the feminine patronymic <i>-iel</i> developed (probably early) by analogy with <i>-ion</i>.<br><br>The roots for “brother/sister” are KHAN and NETH, although NETH can also mean “young girl”. There are also the roots TORON and THEL(ES) for “brotherhood/sisterhood”, used especially with those not related by blood.<br><br>Also note that I’d consider as viable alternatives using the root EM for “mother” (S. <i>emel</i> and Q. <i>emme</i> or *<i>emelle</i>) and/or the root YEL(DE) for “daughter” (Q. <i>yelde</i>, S. <i>iell</i>). I think you should stick with a consistent scenario however, and I intend to use AM/NAN and SEL(DE) myself.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ekin-gören">Ekin Gören</a> Good point, but I think grammatical inflections are more likely to violate phonetic rules (through analogy) than ordinary words. <br><br>Also, it occurred to me after posting this that the true cognate of MQ. <i>amil</i> would be N. <i>evil</i>. That may explain why Tolkien marked <i>emil</i> as archaic and coined <i>naneth</i> as an alternative. I can’t imagine I’m the first person to have noticed this, though.<br><br>Carrying this forward, the cognate of Q. <i>emil</i> would be S. <i>ivil</i>. If you do pick EM for mother, probably Q. <i>emme</i> is your best choice, so you can assume S. emel < *emmele with an extra feminizing suffix added. </div>
