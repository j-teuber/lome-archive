It's meant for the very beginners, the sort of thing that can take the punishment  of 100 people all at once deciding that they want to "learn Elvish", and it's meant to be easy to cite when bringing up one little chunk of grammar.  It wouldn't replace the advanced course that can only handle a few people at a time, the course that stretches ones translation muscles and involves me annotating the translations people send me and interacting with them.</div>

The goal is to make the learner more independent.<br><br>I also divided the lessons into 6 sections, starting with the noun and building the grammar out from there, into more and more complex phrase and sentence structures.

        <div class="content">Your basic outline looks sound to me. You may want to consider having a “lesson 0” where you give a high level overview of the parts of speech and introduce (very basic) verb conjugation and pronouns, so you can give more realistic sample sentences earlier in the course.<br><br>Covering mutations very early is definitely the right way to go, but if you talk about the parts of speech in lesson 0, you can mention how soft mutation also applies to adjectives in lesson 1.1 and the reinforce it and cover it in detail in lesson 1.7 (for example). </div>
