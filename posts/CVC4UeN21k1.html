        <div class="content">This is a tough question. I think the solution is to look at the derivation of <i>lembas</i>. Tolkien originally derived the initial element from primitive *<i>ledmē</i> < LED (PE17:51) but later gave a derivation from OS. <i>lenn-mbas</i> or <i>len-bas</i> (PM:404, RC:329). If these are not from LED, they are most likely from a root LEN (PE17:60), which might mean "way" (EtymAC:LEN). <br><br>I think other Sindarin derivatives of LED could also be transferred to LEN. This lets us preserve <i>anglenna-</i> and <i>edlenn</i> and <i>edledhron</i> (since OS. <i>nr</i> > <i>dhr</i>). I would guess <i>ledh-</i> would become <i>lenna-</i> so <i>edlenna-</i> and <i>nelenna-</i>. <br><br>Alternately, you could ignore Quendi and Eldar, assume that LED remains the normal root for "travel" and that DEL is a variant appearing in a few words. </div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> The question for me is also about transitivity/intransitivity and about how to express 'to send smth./smb.' in Sindarin (if <i>*menna-</i> to be considered Q. influence). If we wish to retain <i>anglenna-</i>, which fits too well into (G?)LEN-theory, then, without the intensifying prefix, <i>(g)lenna-</i> can only mean something like 'go, proceed in unspecified direction', close to Q. <i>lelya-</i> (impossible in S.; I don't like rejecting "Quendi and Eldar" at all, banishment of later texts in favour of earlier and texts with an in-universe story in favour of mere word-lists and careless jottings seems unfair to me). Hence, we'd likely produce <i>lenna-</i> < len-nā than len-tā — but such a word is strange to consider it underlying in <i>edledh</i>-cluster. Possibly, having also <i>edlenn</i>, <i>edledhron</i> and, most importantly, <i>edledhia</i>, the most probable scenario fells to be <i>edlenna</i> < et-len-tā 'to exile' (pt. part. edlennen, ancient=adj. edlenn) vs. <i>edlenia</i> 'to go into exile', which retains <i>edledhron</i> as it was. Then <i>neledhi</i> updates to <i>neleni</i> or <i>nelenia</i>, <i>anglenna</i> remains; but * lenna < len-tā 'send, make move' (cf. Q. menna, rejected lesta) and * (g)lenna < len-nā 'proceed' are homonymic. (Could the initial G be a mark of difference and possibly show S. late rendering of Q. menta in 'sending' meaning?) I have nothing against homonyms which a bring to me an additional feeling of language "reality", but all of these are definitely my own speculations. (I'd note also that [PE17:51] claims of 'LED rarely featured in Sindarin beside <i>edlenn</i>' can be easily reassigned as 'LEN rarely featured in Sindarin…'; furthermore, my main goal is somehow to retain <i>anglenna</i>, which is a very successful and well-imagined word, and it remains unchanged but in derivation).﻿</div>

        <div class="content">I think your reasoning is sound if you accept LEN as a replacement for LED as the root of some Sindarin words.<br><br>This is why I said it was a "tough question". When speculating on new words outside of Tolkien's written texts, there are multiple criteria you can use. My own approach to neo-Sindarin and neo-Quenya is different. I prefer to retain as many forms created by Tolkien as possible, as long as those forms are internally consistent with each other.<br><br>Rather than inventing new words, I prefer go back all the way to Gnomish if a word is available, provided I can reconcile that word with the other words I include in Sindarin. This means that in some cases, I end up excluding certain primitive forms and phonetic rules Tolkien wrote for the later forms of his languages.<br><br>To give an unrelated example, in Noldorin, medial <i>nth</i>, <i>mph</i> became <i>nn</i> and <i>mm</i>. In Sindarin, Tolkien modified this rule, so that medial <i>lth</i> became <i>ll</i> as well (PE17:131, VT42:27). If I accept this rule, I would be forced to modify the half-dozen verbs ending in <i>ltha-</i> in the Etymologies to <i>lla-</i> (or to reject them outright).<br><br>However, I know of only two Sindarin word to which the rule <i>lth</i> > <i>ll</i> apply: (1) <i>mallorn</i> and (2) <i>tollui</i>. In the case of <i>tollui</i> (VT42:25), Tolkien also gave a variant form <i>tolthui</i> (VT42:27) that was a reformation of the original pronunciation based on the spelling. In the case of <i>mallorn</i> (PE17:50), maybe the word has some other derivation from the root MAL.<br><br>Furthermore, if I ignore this particular phonetic rule, I can preserve a dozen Noldorin words unmodified. So is it better to use (for example) <i>toltha-</i> or <i>tolla-</i> for the Sindarin verb for "to fetch"? I think both approaches are equally valid, and it is a matter of personal preference.<br><br>As a final note, in my personal head-canon, I do believe that <i>mallorn</i> originated from OS <i>malthorn</i>, but changed its pronunciation to <i>mallorn</i> perhaps under the influence of Nandorin, so that <i>lth</i> > <i>ll</i> in this case, but not as a general rule.</div>
