        <div class="content">So in the past few years I got granted the chance of composing elvish lyrics for professionally produced songs, which to my and the producer's astonishments went through the ceiling receiving some fancy awards...<br><br>Now, I'm not here to brag about it! But much more putting the lyrics I came up for discussion, the final songs of course won't be changed anymore, but I feel like they provide some nice things to discuss on ;)<br><br>The Artist is called Oonagh (name has a celtic origin) and most of her songs feature german choruses and Elvish (Mostly Quenya, sometimes Sindarin) refrains. I am aware that in some songs I did stretch the grammar or other aspects of elvish quite far, but other than "regular" translations, these lines have to fulfill all of the following:<br><br>- Number of syllables has to match<br>- Stress of elvish words has to match desired stresses of the lines<br>- Vowels should be as close to producers imagination as possible<br>- Lines have to be "hooky" (meaning they stick to listeners minds and are easily recognized)<br>- As easy as possible to pronounce for the singer<br>- Meaning should fit to rest of song and should match to lore<br>- Correct grammar and vocabulary<br><br>Here's a first of the many songs I worked on:<br><br><strong>Oonagh: Feanor</strong><br><br><strong>Refrain:</strong><br><i>Feanor, Feanor</i><br><i>Calaher</i><br><i>Mana men antanelyë</i><br><i>Ardava harmar úsestimë</i><br><br><i>Feanor, Feanor</i><br><i>Moriher</i><br><i>Tuncel menn' alta nyérë</i><br><i>Nahtanel Eldar únótimë</i><br><br>My general idea of the refrain was to have the first half highlight Feanor's positive sites and deeds, and the second half the negative things.<br><br>Here's the literal english translation:<br><br>Feanor, Feanor<br>Lord of Light<br>What(1) us gave-you<br>Arda's treasures unmatched(2)<br><br>Feanor, Feanor<br>Lord of Darkness<br>Brought-you to-us(3) great sorrow<br>Slew-you Eldar countless<br><br><br>(1) <i>Mana</i> = what (interrogative, not relative): The sentence structure of this and the following line is a bit funky, but I'd explain it as that the third line is a kind of question - "What did he give us?" -  and the 4th line is the immidiate answer - "Arda's unmatched treasures".<br><br>(2) <i>úsestime</i> "unmatched, incomparable" << <i>sestima</i> << PE12:82 (QL) <i>sesta-</i> "to liken, compare, make like, model on, assimilate, imitate"<br><br>(3) <i>menn' alta</i> elided from << <i>menna alta</i><br><br>Here's the song on Youtube: <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eng0NXlTpL0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eng0NXlTpL0</a><br><br>In case anyone is interested in an english translation of the german parts (which werent made by me) I'll happily provide them. Also please tell me whether you'd like to see more of these ;)</div>
