        <div class="content">I also should introduce myself: I'm Maike Luthien (incidentally, both are my real christian names) and somehow the link to this circle (?) popped up, but whether that was by email, Elfling list, facebook or otherwise - I've got no idea. I've been a (admittedly not very active) Elfling list member since 2008 and, together with Tuilinde (Susan Edwards) I run a small forum dedicated to elvish languages at <a class="ext-link" href="http://parendili.org/teithad">parendili.org/teithad</a> .<br>I am interested mainly in Sindarin and have studied that using Skype etc. ever since I found a study partner on Elfling almost five years ago. I'm interested in writing and speaking Sindarin; I've written some poems in Sindarin, both translations of English originals and some by myself. <br><br>I also like creating Tolkien Legendarium-related artwork, mostly based on the Silmarillion or the Lost Tales. I had some of that on display at last summer's Return of the Ring. <br><br>And lastly, I'm still working on a Sindarin dictionary application. That's become a bit of a long winding project but I still hope to produce a usable version of that in the not all too distant future :)<br><br>-l</div>

        <div class="content">It started as an upgrade of Hesperides (a dictionary application by Didier Willis) but eventually I switched to using a more recent vocabulary (including the PE17 words and some more) - that was being put together by (I hope I remember it right, I should look it up) Roman of the <a class="ext-link" href="http://sindarin.de">sindarin.de</a> forum. <br><br>It's great to hear someone is interested, because that does help my motivation to get back on it :)<br><br>If you like you can download a test version to try out, I'll see if it's still available on our web host. If you want to read more about it, there is a topic on <a class="ext-link" href="http://parendili.org">parendili.org</a> about it.</div>

        <div class="content">Ah yes indeed  thanks!<br><br>Some technical details: it is written Java and uses a SQLite database, so it runs on all desktop & laptop computers. <br>For ease of installing I might provide platform specific installers though (I still have to investigate that). <br><br>It can also run inside a browser (it's using javafx2), but I need to do a bit more research on the details. I was also thinking of creating a portable platform version to run on devices such as the ipad, iphone, android etc. but I have no idea how much work it is to port a java app to those platforms. <br><br>Using a database for storage is the largest difference from Hesperides, which used a large XML file. <br>The advantage of using a database is that it is much easier to update the contents, add your own annotations or newly constructed words - this would of course only be stored in your local instance.<br><br>But it also opens up interesting possibilities for either updating the "main" vocabulary or people submitting corrections or newly constructed words that might be interesting for other users.<br><br>One possibility is to create a "submit" function with which people could send their local update to a central location. We would of course then need some sort of (knowledgeable) validation before it would be entered into the main vocabulary.<br><br>In order to keep the purist happy it should be possible to turn displaying this additional content on or off. <br><br>We've already talked about these issues and there's even a proposal how to realise it, but because of 'being busy with all sorts of other things' the whole thing could use a new impulse: so any input, be it technical, linguistic or just from a user perspective is very welcome.<br><br>We've been discussing this on Sindarin.de (mostly in German) and also on <a class="ext-link" href="http://parendili.org/teithad/">parendili.org/teithad/</a> (in English) so maybe it is easier to use one of those locations for that?<br><br><br><br></div>

        <div class="content">Hi +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#lúthien-merilin">Lúthien Merilin</a> making it cross-platform is a good choice; I am looking forward to trying it. I also think SQLite will work better than XML.<br>Having NeoSindarin words in it could be a good idea if they are clearly distinguished from the attested vocabulary and there are frequent reminders popping up to warn the unsuspecting newbie.<br>Peer review before incorporatign the word into the dictionary is also an excellent idea - where you do it, on <a class="ext-link" href="http://sindarin.de">sindarin.de</a>, or Elfing, or other places, is really up to you, wherever you feel comfortable:)<br><br>Come visit Aglardh some day, which is my site - postings are infrequent these days but there are some good discussions and texts there.</div>

        <div class="content">@Erica: I started by listening and (trying to) speak, because I've noticed before that this sort of immersion works very well for me. For the listening part I used a couple of Sindarin readings that I found on YouTube (mostly), though later it turned out that some of them weren't all that good.<br>For the reading part, I printed out some Sindarin texts (poems), studied the pronunciation rules and then just read them out as often as I could (when walking alone, for instance). At first I did not even know the grammar. <br>The idea is that after a while you get used to the general sounds of the language which makes it easier to learn the formal grammar. I started on that as soon as I found a study partner, which was not long afterwards (maybe two months).<br><br>It basically works as with learning any other foreign language. It does take effort and time, and occasions to use the language written and (I think) also in speech. It helps a great deal to have a study partner with whom you can practice. <br><br>Hope this helps! <br></div>
