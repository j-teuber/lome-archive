        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#severin-zahler">Severin Zahler</a> Sorry for the slow response.  I somehow missed this post. <br><br>You mostly have the marks correct. The others:<br><br>** Are for forms that are known to be incorrect. Mostly they are things that Tolkien indicated should not happen. <br><br>| is for forms that appear in a deleted section that were not themselves individually deleted. It is a weaker version of -, which is used only for forms that were directly marked out by Tolkien. For example, if Tolkien wrote a word within some discussion of a grammatical function, then changed his mind and deleted that section of text, he might still have considered the word to be valid, having rejected the text for some other reason. <br><br>Finally, ^ is for a neologism adapted to a later version of a language based on established phonetic changes. It is mostly used for Noldorin words adapted to the phonology of Sindarin. <br><br>This last mark is part of a chain of certainty, ranging from (unmarked) > # > * > ^ > ! > **, going from most to least certain, with the last one being definitely wrong.<br><br>All the other options are combinations of two other marks. <br><br>I will look at the two element refs you mentioned. They are probably errors. <br><br></div>

        <div class="content">I'm a bit confused by the "*" mark. In your Terminology you wrote "* marks words that are unattested but can be reasonably deduced by comparison to other words", however when searching for "mark="*"" in the eldamo file I find many references with proper primary source that bear this mark, so they can't be unattested as a whole. Can it be that i.e. only the gloss is guessed or so? However that would contrast those references that have no gloss at all, assuming they're unknown...</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#severin-zahler">Severin Zahler</a> Regarding *, these are really reconstructed words rather than words that are not attested at all. The most common example of these are words that only appear as an element in a compound. That is why there are references with the * mark, which point to the portion of the compound where the word element appears. <br><br>I will take a look at the other issues you are reporting, but they sound like errors. <br><br>And don't apologize, I really appreciate the deep look you are taking of the Eldamo data, because you are definitely helping improve the quality of the data. </div>
