        <div class="content">The most common kind of compound word is what's called "endocentric:" it includes the thing that it is. So a houseboat is a kind of boat; a shoe salesman is a kind of salesman; a whoremonger is a kind of monger. (That being an old word for a dealer or trader) The second most common is "exocentric:" made out of nouns and adjectives, but not including the thing that it is. (e.g., a loudmouth is not a kind of mouth, but a kind of person.)<br><br>This is all about a third category: exocentric compounds that are built out of verbs, which describe what the thing does. +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#brianne-hughes">Brianne Hughes</a>  wrote her master's thesis on these, where she named them "cutthroat compounds," after such an example: A cutthroat is someone who cuts throats.<br><br>These are surprisingly rare in English, but are common among kids: apparently, children go through a phase where they spontaneously generate lots of these, and then stop.<br><br>This is what's called a "productive" grammar: you can make up new ones and people will understand you, so if I call someone a lack-faith or Bob Stealhorse people will understand me. But they don't fit naturally into English grammar, because English is what's called a "head-initial" language: you tend to put the most significant part of a phrase or sentence first. Since English verbs have to go before their objects, this gets it backwards; it sounds like more natural English to call someone "faithless" or a "horse-thief." That's why, apart from a few cases which happened to survive, English has relatively few cutthroat compounds.<br><br>But the few we keep are pretty great, and tend to be very evocative: a sawbones, a killjoy, a slingshot.

        <div class="content">Yes, and other types. Endocentric (tatpurusha) in Sindarin examples: balrog, rochben, dirnaith, Exocentric (bahuvrihi) examples: anfang, lachenn. Other types in Sindarin are copulative compounds (dvandva), e.g. ann-thennath, or names such as Iorhael. Can't think of any appositional compounds offhand though.</div>

        <div class="content">You should definitely consult David Salo's essay on compounds in <i>Gateway to Sindarin</i> pp. 173-178; he lists seven main classes plus some non-standard examples. I believe all Eldarin tongues are very rich in compounds and their formation methods, and this is the reason we are never stumped over the limits of vocabulary: making a compound is the safest well-attested method of producing predictable words.﻿<br>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> Concerning 'cut-throat' ones, though Sindarin is very rich in verb + object compounds, which are one of the most productive patterns, it normally puts object first (<i>bas-oneth</i> etc.); still, Salo lists two very proper ones, <i>medli</i> < mad + glî 'eat-honey, a bear' and <i>talagan</i> < talan + gand 'play-harp, a harper'. These are characteristic for old stage of language but get rare in modern forms and remain non-productive.﻿</div>
