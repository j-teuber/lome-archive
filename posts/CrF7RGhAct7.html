        <div class="content">"Erch" is from Noldorin, from what I can tell. I included it because there are examples of the same pattern in mature Sindarin. It also matches the "lost final-syllable vowel" so it makes sense that it'd be one such word. But, for Woodelves, learning Sindarin as a second language, with their accent that Frodo found difficult to understand, I could see them not knowing about the lost vowel, and treating the remaining vowel as a final-syllable vowel. So, they'd say the plural "yrch".... that's one of the complexities I'm trying to get across in the lesson: the differences of dialect. </div>

        <div class="content">Regarding <i>erch</i>:<br><br>The plurals <i>erch, eirch</i> are from LR:406, still Noldorin. However, the pattern itself recurs in Sindarin, see <i>egl, eigl</i> from <i>ogl</i> (PE17:149), for example, so I wouldn't dismiss them. Still, I would prefer <i>yrch</i> because it is clearly mentioned in the specifically Sindarin sources: The Lord of the Rings, Quendi & Eldar and some places in PE17.<br>At one point in PE17 Tolkien toys with the idea that <i>yrch</i> should be a Nandorin dialectal form (as basically does with any words and names potentially related to the Nandor), but other sources have no mention of it. Moreover, the pattern <i>o</i> > <i>y</i> is amply attested otherwise.<br><br>Regarding the lesson:<br><br>The development of long vowels should be like that:<br>CE /e:/ > OS /i:/ > S /i:/<br>CE /o:/ > OS /u:/ > S /u:/<br>CE /a:/ (perhaps rather /ɑ:/) > OS /ɔ:/ > S /au/ (North Sindarin retains /ɔ:/)<br>Short /a/, /ε/, /i/, /u/ are unchanged. Unless I'm oblivious to some recently published material, there shouldn't be any short close /e/, /o/; or they're not relevant.<br><br>The change /œi/ > /y/ doesn't seem to be right, /œ/ simply loses rounding in Sindarin, giving /ε/, so /œi/ should give /εi/ (but not /ai/, I would think).<br>The mutation of /ɔ/ to /y/ is most likely caused by a different intermediate change, namely raising to /u/ (see Bertrand Bellet's excellent article on vowel mutations, for example). Hence: *coroni > *coruni > *ceryn.<br><br>It's somehow confusing to see <i>geil → gail, celeir → celair</i> in a textbox, as they look like plural formations, although they are shifts in the singular.<br>Also, it is not right to say that when "/i:/ occurred in a single-syllable word, it became EI". Long /i:/ was unchanged. <i>Geil</i>  and <i>gail</i> come from <i>giljā</i> with a-mutation causing the lowering /i/ > /ε/ and subsequent i-mutation. The plural was <i>*gilī</i>, yielding <i>gîl</i>.<br>In fact, one can formulate this as a simple rule: Whenever there are two variants with <i>eI</i> and <i>ai</i>, the plural has <i>î</i>. When there is only <i>ai</i> without a variant, the plural (most likely) stays <i>ai</i>.<br><br><i>Fang</i> 'beard' is from <i>sphanga</i> (so attested in Old Noldorin, CE <i>spangā</i>). SPÁNAG- is the root, with the acute denoting stress.</div>

        <div class="content">I'm not saying that orch → yrch isn't valid, I'm saying that it is also valid. Using final-syllable mutation on previously non-final syllable vowels I think could be used to mark the speaker as a young elf, or an elf that learned Sindarin as a second language, or a Gondorian using it as a second language.  That would be the majority of the Sindarin speakers making the plural of orch → yrch.<br><br>For /a:/ (or /ɑ:/) I think that the /au/ comes out only when on a stressed syllable, and then, only sometimes.<br>Anor vs naur vs nórui vs bauglir<br>Glorfindel vs Glaurung<br>I think it suited Tolkien's tastes to have scary/evil names and words with the AU diphthong in them.<br><br>/u/ → /ɔ/ and /i/ → /ɛ/ could happen because of A-affection...

        <div class="content"><i>I'm confused.. o > y is the final-syllable rule, o > e the non-final one...</i><br><br>That's the point... there's a small number of plurals in Sindarin and Noldorin that have I-Affection only, and no final-syllable vowel mutation. Hypothetically, there was a final syllable that was lost. In some words, that lost final syllable is retained in the plural form (ôl>ely), but in others, it is also lost (fang>feng). Of course, such special forms could easily be lost by analogical changes, and the different forms could stay around simultaneously, as you said:<br><br><i>Yes, one important thing to realize is that Sindarin is perfectly happy with several plural forms existing at the same time,</i><br><br>Which is the point of introducing these cases. When I translate into Sindarin, I try to keep it from a perspective of a character that's living there. I very rarely translate as from my own perspective. When I do, I chose the dialect that gets out what I want to say the easiest, usually the Noldor-influenced Western Sindarin because I can Sindarinize Quenya words to fill in vocabulary, or the Doriathrin dialect if I'm feeling fancy.<br><br>It's true that we have very little information about what the features of various dialects are. These are some differences that I've inferred are likely. I didn't assign them at random... though I do cherry-pick from Tolkien's many revisions to some extent, especially when it comes to the Woodelven dialect. That one is probably the most iffy of my hypotheticals piled on hypotheticals.<br><br><i>Exactly, and there is good evidence for that, namely the development of Osse's Valarin name Oššai in WJ:400: Ossai > ussi > yssɪ̯; and also the Early Noldorin plural of orn 'tree': ornei > urnī > yrn (PE13:116).</i><br><br>Thanks! I shall include this in the main chart. Do you think that the raising happened to the /e/ and /ɑ/ too? It could explain why there seems to be two different E's in Old Sindarin at one point.<br><br>BTW, what do you think the history of "it rains" would look like? In Noldorin it's <strong>œil</strong>, but I think it would be <strong>yl</strong> or <strong>ŷl</strong> in Sindarin. What do you think?<br><br><i>Mine are also falling out and are quite battered at the edges.. I recall the mention of someone having published the Etymologies as a booklet without the Lost Road part. Now that is a great idea!..</i><br><br>What I need to do is get a hard-cover copy, so I can use the page number citations in Dragonflame. Right now, the citations are useless to me, other than giving very vague ideas of where I could find a word. Also, I bet it would last longer. I tend to annotate books as I read them, to help me process the information, which means they get worn out more quickly. I met up with Aaron Shaw (we grew up in the same valley in Montana, barely 10 miles from eachother, only a couple years apart in age), and his Tolkien books are pristine in comparison to mine.</div>
