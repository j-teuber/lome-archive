        <div class="content">A new feature I propose: a regular +<a class="tag" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#storyofaroot">#StoryOfARoot</a> . Today: TĀ, TAγ, TAR, 'tall' and 'stand'.<br><br>* <strong>Late 1930s</strong> In <i>the Etymologies,</i> the stem TĀ, ?TAγ 'high, lofty, noble' is described in detail. The summary is as follows: <i>tárá</i> 'lofty' is Q <i>tára</i>, but not used in N due to homonymy of resulting <i>taur</i> with 'forest', surviving only in compounds: <i>Tor, dor</i>. <i>Tārō</i> 'king', <i>tārī</i> 'queen', only of a whole tribe: in Q <i>tár, tári</i> (second of Varda mostly), in Ilk <i>tôr, tôril</i> of Thingol and Melian only, in N unused. Here also cf. <i>Taniquetil</i> which first element may me bare TĀ but presumably is rather <i>tána</i> < <i>taγna</i> which survived in cognate N <i>taen</i> 'height, summit'.<br>No verbal stem for 'standing' is mention in Etym.<br><br>* <strong>1948</strong> In QVS and the supporting documents, the idea of 'tall' is mostly rendered by a parallel KHAL and so passes out of our scope. The very first mention of 'stand' is an inceptive, 'stand up', <i>tolu</i>, which could be from TOL (114). The epic description of various location verbs on 125 etc. gives (126) THAR, <i>thára</i> as 'stand (of people, animals); of mountains, high hills, towers, pillars etc.' Yet, above this item Tolkien writes (remembering?) the older stem TOL. <i>Tolu</i> is allowed to stay in CE:VS as well.<br><br>* <strong>Late 1950s</strong> A change to this came, presumably, when Tolkien needed THAR for Sindarin 'across/athwart' in <i>Tharbad</i> etc. See PE17:014, 034 [both DLN, late 1950s]. Cf. also <i>Athrabeth</i> of the same time. A totally new picture emerges from QE and supporting texts now. Basically, it is underlined in QE by the notion of <i>Valarin-derived Taniquetil</i>, which we shall study most carefully, it being a well-researched and non-spontaneous writing:<br><i>As they say, ta does not mean 'lofty' in Eldarin, though it may remind one of tára 'tall, high' (TAR).</i> <i>Taniquetil</i> is from V <i>Dahan igwiš tilgūn</i> of unclear meaning.<br>In short, the mere existence of stem TĀ 'tall' is attributed to a fault of more ancient (pre-Pengolodh) Loremasters, while the idea of 'tallness' should be rendered basically as TAR — a stem which never before appeared in such a form. Perhaps it is no coincidence that its emergence nicely fits with the (temporary) elimination of γ from among the basic CE formation elements.<br><br>However, the most peculiar thing here shall be the amount of post-QE observations, collected in PE17 and PE22.<br><br>* <strong>1964</strong> In ca. 1964, while writing the <i>Notes on Galadriel's Song</i> (NGS) based still on the 1st edition text, he (PE17:67) mentions the remaining <i>tári</i> as a feminine 'her highness' from the same <i>tára</i> 'high' (without a further explanation).<br>* <strong>1964</strong> The essay on 'And', which, together with <i>Comparative in Eldarin</i> and <i>Ambar etc.</i> can be assigned to around 1964—1967: all of them are written on the same paper with identical writing instruments employed, and though mentioning Plotz feature the older possessive endings before <i>omentielvo</i>. At ibid.:71, Tolkien not only gives us <i>astarmo</i> 'witness' vs. newer <i>astarindo</i> 'bystander, supporter' (note especially, that the derived <i>rm</i> shows either TAR or TAS; TAD would <i>tanmo > tanwo</i> or <i>tammo</i> per PE19:96, and TAγ/TĀ would render <i>támo</i> alike); he writes a complete sentence about 'standing', and it is <i>Sanome tarne Olórin etc.</i> An ambiguous way of showing a verb (<i>tarya</i> per <i>sirya</i> also suffices, as is A-verb <i>tara</i>), but the stem TAR is explicit (TAγ to <i>tange</i>). Finally: the stem for 'stand' is TAR here, and 'loftiness' is not discussed at all.<br>* <strong>1964</strong> But where 'loftiness' <i>does</i> appear is <i>Comparative in Eldarin</i> from the same batch (actually, the reverse of the first edition, ibid. 186—187). Here Tolkien writes first as above, 'TAR, stand, intransitive' — and then sees an apparent discrepancy: should <i>tāra</i> be 'upstart' or something then, not 'tall'? Hence the infamous <i>ups</i>. He once again goes to Valarin for answer, asking himself to ignore <i>Taniquetil</i> as 'of unknown meaning' and apparently replace all 'tall' words with derivatives of ORO 'rise', <i>orwa, orna</i>. Below he, nevertheless, finds a different solution: <i>bring Etym TAγ back!</i> The thing he writes is literally: 'No, but TAγ in tagra > tāra, S taer. TARA, stand', which can be understood: if the stem for 'tall' is TAγ — as <i>the Etymologies</i> were so keen to insist — then <i>tára and all its derivatives</i> can be explained as <i>a medial collapse of γ intervocalic and pre-consonant (PE19:100-101)! Hence, a derivational suffix _ra</i> with its agental counterparts <i>ro/ri</i> are held responsible for <i>tára, tári</i> etc. — while 'stand' is basically verbal TAR, <i>tare, tára, tarne, atárie, taruva</i> which just coincidentally (or showing an earlier connection) gets to a 'lofty' territory.<br><br>All of that nice and cool and apparently solved — but further complications arise ca. 1969.<br>* <strong>1969</strong> We proceed to LVS in PE22. Two objects are of interest here: at the reverse of LVS1 Tolkien writes, among similar forms (148), '_tarhanwa_ throne, high seat'. The corresponding comments make it clear that the second stem is KHAD, a well-known rendering of 'seat', hence TAR refers to 'high' — again! (Yet if we suggest that it is a shortened <i>tára</i>, not an application of the root itself, barely possible in Eldarin morphology, then it is still plausible as <i>taγ-rā-khad-mā > tarhanwa</i>). Anyway, he chose an unproblematic and QE-attested <i>mahalma</i> for the Oath of Cirion, and the issue was solved.<br>* <strong>1969</strong> The <i>face</i> of LVS1, however, offers a further complication (147): <i>lan i Valaron arkanwar tauvar</i>. The meaning is clear (LotR V:5, 'while the thrones of the Valar endure'). However, <i>what is the verb</i>?! No apparent 'endure' stems apply (RETH/RES, BOR, BOR-ON, which Tolkien uses in the same Oath around the same year and is definitely not forgotten and/or abandoned). A mere 'stand' seems the likeliest pattern: and the description of object position at PE22:125-126 implies 'standing' here in Q. However, TAR cannot render <i>tauva</i> — any way; this shows and irreversible TĀ, the aforementioned TAγ, even unattested TAB or TAW — but never TAR, which remains as it is (the attested TA-stems include: TAK 'fix', TAM 'construct', TAN and TAS 'show, indicate', TAY 'extend' and TAW 'wood'; TAY could yield <i>tauva</i> though unlikely but neither 'extension' nor 'woodenness' of the holy thrones is not fit here). It seems that Tolkien experiments with making a verb out of TAγ, and the verb is 'stand' or something close! Perhaps Tolkien thought about a basic verb 'rise, tower, dominate, stay tall'?<br><br><i>Significatio.</i><br><br>Can we produce a fit conclusion not just by summarising what we know — but by proposing a 'final' explanation of the roots fit to use, which Tolkien himself would accept? Possibly. I shall write down the following themes:<br><br>* We are dealing with two stems, possibly connected from an early stage, yet distinct. The first CE stem did not possess a form TĀ, like many Loremasters did assert; the basic form can be reconstructed as TAγ. The stem meant 'be high, lofty' and hence 'be noble' and produced its most important derivation — an adjective <i>taγrā > tārā</i>, Q <i>tára</i>, S <i>taer</i> 'lofty' (which made a natural contact with <i>daer</i> 'large, great' from DAY). The titular names, <i>táro</i> 'king' and <i>tári</i> 'queen' were in Quenya reserved for the highest authorities among the Valar or overlords of the whole tribes (Ingwe, Finwe, Olwe, Thingol) and in Sindarin were lost altogether, surviving only as a prefix or suffix <i>tar, tor, dor</i> (ablauted) in compound names, meaning 'lord': <i>Torhir Iphant, Arador, Celebrindor, Findor, Galador, Galdor, Gildor, Gwindor, Meneldor, Orchaldor, Thorondor,</i> perhaps also <i>Gundor, Uldor, Targon</i> and some more. The mountain-name <i>Taniquetil</i>, though from Valarin, was also felt to be connected somehow. Basically, however, the stem was still much <i>verbal</i> and such produced some verb 'to be exalted, to tower, to oversee': a possible form (we don't have much information about γ-verbs (reformed, per PE22:102). A good guess, after <i>caita</i> (PE22:159) and <i>lauya</i> (ibid.:156), will be <i>táya, táya, taine, atáye, tauva</i>.<br>* The second stem is TAR 'to stand': an obviously basic verb, <i>tare, tára, tarne, atárie, taruva</i> which is used not only for standing persons but for mountains, hills, towers, pillars and everything that is more 'tall' than 'wide' — <i>never</i> for lower hills, buildings, dwellings or cities. Derivatives <i>astarmo</i> 'witness', also <i>astarindo</i> 'supporter'.<br><br><br><br><i>Special thanks to </i>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a><i>, </i>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#fiona-jallings">Fiona Jallings</a><i>, </i>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ܤܡܝ-ܦܠܕܢܝܘܤ">ܤܡܝ ܦܠܕܢܝܘܤ</a><i> </i>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ܤܡܝ-ܦܠܕܢܝܘܤ">ܤܡܝ ܦܠܕܢܝܘܤ</a><i> </i>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ܤܡܝ-ܦܠܕܢܝܘܤ">ܤܡܝ ܦܠܕܢܝܘܤ</a><i> </i>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#ܤܡܝ-ܦܠܕܢܝܘܤ">ܤܡܝ ܦܠܕܢܝܘܤ</a><i>, </i>+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a><i>.
