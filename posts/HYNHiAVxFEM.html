        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#matt-dinse">Matt Dinse</a>  I haven't gotten around to including PE16 in my notes, so I was missing those references. Thanks for the pointers. The example <i>sana</i> (PE16:96) is another late instance of <i>sa-</i> being used as a demonstrative that I didn't know about. It looks like there is an attested instance of allative <i>tanna</i> in the 1955+ poem (vs <i>tar(a)</i>) that I also didn't know about.<br><br>I haven't had time to analyze the poem in detail yet, but I suspect that this example of <i>sana</i> is a remnant of the Early Quenya demonstrative root SA (PE12:81). For purposes of Neo-Quenya writing, I personally would prefer to reserve Q. <i>sa</i> for 3rd singular neuter, since we have the better attested <i>ta-</i> to use for the demonstrative. But clearly an argument could be made the other way.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a>  I suspect that demonstratives in <i>sa-</i> and <i>ta-</i> could coexist in later Quenya, with <i>sa-</i> acting like Sindarin <i>han</i> (said to be from <i>san</i> in PE17:42). Pl. <i>hain</i> is "that" in the sense of "those, them, <i>the things previously mentioned.</i>" (my emphasis), and in PE16:96-7 the editors allude to "an unpublished discussion of Quenya demonstrative and relative pronouns (probably dating from around the 1940s)" in which "Tolkien explains that <i>sa</i> refers 'to a time already in mind or under discussion' or 'a place already discussed,' and that <i>sana</i> means 'that very thing (already referred to)' and is one of a group of pronouns that are adjectival in form but 'used substantivally.' In the phrase <i>sana wende</i> we probably have the adjectival usage itself, with a meaning like "that very maiden" or "that same maiden", referring back to <i>Nielikkilis</i> in the previous line and further qualified by the relative clause in the next line."<br><br><i>sana</i> is used when we already know that <i>wende</i> = <i>Nielikkilis</i>, and <i>hain</i> is used to refer to previously-mentioned <i>Ennyn</i>. In other cases where "that" does not refer to something previously mentioned, I would use <i>tana</i>. But I guess that's my own speculation.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#matt-dinse">Matt Dinse</a>  The connection to S. <i>han</i> is another excellent point in favor of the <i>sa-</i> demonstrative that I had not considered. I promise to keep an open mind for when I get around to analyzing the information in PE16 (which won't be for a while, because I still have PE13-PE15 to get through).<br><br>Right now, while I agree that <i>sa</i> might co-exist with <i>ta-</i> as a demonstrative, I am not sure it could co-exist with <i>sa</i> as 3rd singular neuter. In VT49:37 note #46, Tolkien indicated that primitive pronominal form <i>sa</i> "this by me of my concern" was associated with primitive <i>si</i> (elsewhere "this, here, now"), and was the source of the neuter pronoun <i>sa</i> "the thing".<br><br>I am not sure how I would explain S. <i>han</i> "that" < <i>san</i> in this scenario, though. Maybe it originally meant "this" and shifted to "that" via semantic drift? I wouldn't want to commit to any particular view until I have looked at all the available information.<br><br>Thanks for the thought-provoking discussion.
