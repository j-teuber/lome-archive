        <div class="content">Actually I disagree. I think it is not easy for new learners to make good choices between contradictory vocabulary words. I know it took me several years of study before I knew enough to make proper distinctions. <br><br>It’s not just a question of synonyms either. There are a large number homonyms with wildly different and even contradictory meaning, which makes reading comprehension very difficult. <br><br>I don’t think Tolkien would have tolerated a language in which yelde, yende and selde all simultaneously meant “sister” and I don’t think we should either. <br><br>However, making the thousands decisions needed to produce an internally consistent Elvish vocabulary is a stupidly huge amount of work, requiring years of research, so I’m not surprised it hasn’t been done yet. </div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> I normally work from the roots. The good starting point is to check whether the whole set of words derived from the root makes sense diachronically in-universe. But it will always be a case-to-case scenario. There is no other algorithm than trying to be as inclusive as it still makes sense, while preferring the words with a strong historical connection. Such as the family relations from Fingers.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#paul-strack">Paul Strack</a> I really wouldn't exclude any word from the vocabulary only because it causes ambiguity (and here I am again not talking about mutually exclusive versions of pronominal endings for instance, but cases like you mentioned with several words meaning "sister"). We cope with ambiguity on a daily basis in our real life languages; we even have contronyms and we don't even bat an eyelid at them.<br>I also think that having <i>choice</i> in the vocabulary would give the langauge a chance to evolve organically - for instance, if the number of speakers picks up and people start using the language, in time the various words having the same meaning could start to diverge and gain added colour (e.g. users may start applying one of the words for "daughter" to daughter-in-laws).</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> I get where you are coming from, I just don't agree. I don't think anyone here would suggest using Early Quenya <i>sui</i> or G. <i>suil</i> for “daughter”, so why should we accept all of <i>yelde, yende, selde</i> and <i>anel</i> just because Tolkien invented these forms after 1930? While Tolkien considered each of these forms a valid word for daughter at one point in time or another, at no time did he conceive of them all being simultaneously valid.<br><br>Regarding which I think is “best”, I think the question is easy to answer by comparing to Sindarin. In the Etymologies we have archaic <i>†sell</i> “girl”, from which is derived N. <i>iell</i> “daughter” on analogy with N. <i>ionn</i> “son”. But in the King’s Letter we have <i>sellath</i> “daughters” and in the Túrin Fragment have the word <i>sel</i>: unglossed, but from context clearly “daughter”. This indicates that by the 1950s, Tolkien changed N. <i>iell</i> >> S. <i>sel(l)</i>. For consistency with its Sindarin cognate, we should probably use Q. <i>selde</i> for “daughter”. The later validity of this form is supported by the diminutive finger name <i>selye</i> from “Eldarin Hands, Fingers and Numbers”.<br><br>If we all agree that having a normative grammar for the languages is a good thing, I think it is also worth aspiring to have a normative vocabulary list as well, especially if we want to have a coherent language. Such a normative vocabulary is a larger and more difficult undertaking, but it is, in fact, the ultimate goal of my Eldamo project. At the rate I am going, it will probably be another 5 or 6 years before I get there, though. Something community based might get there sooner, and produce a better result.<br><br>And +<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#александр-запрягаев">Александр Запрягаев</a> I agree that basing such a normative vocabulary on proper roots and phonological histories is essential.</div>
