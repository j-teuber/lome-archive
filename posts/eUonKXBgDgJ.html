It could be a variant related to the root <i>TOR-</i>, seen in <i>torech</i> and meaning something like 'hidden, secret, closed'?

Elsewhere on the Wrapper we have <i>en</i> as possibly our first attested form of the S present tense copula, which Carl links (probably correctly) to <i>aen</i> from KL, so <i>en</i>: present indicative, <i>aen</i>: subjunctive.

I mean,  do we have to consider it as a triple possessive? "...the ? (I have no idea what <i>cem</i> is supposed to mean) of the Dwarves of the Elves"?

"of the Dwarves (and) the Elves"? <br><br>Maybe it's rubbish (I don't have VT/50 yet), but what if <i>en</i> actually means "also", "likewise" or something like that (i.e., <i>en i naugrim en ir Ellath</i> = "both the Dwarves and the Elves" or "likewise the Dwarves, likewise the Elves")?</div>

        <div class="content">- Noun phrases joined without a conjunction 'and' did appear before, cf. Q. <i>ve laure ve misil</i> *'like gold and silver' (VT27:27) (lit. 'like gold, like silver'), and perhaps also G. <i>u laud u laith</i> *'neither flood nor time' (lit. 'not flood not time').<br>But my first idea when looking at the sentence was also that <i>en</i> could mean 'likewise, as well', especially regarding Q. <i>en, ena</i> 'still' and S. eno *'still' in the Area II sentence. The semantic range 'again, once more, do repeatedly' ~ 'enduring state' ~ 'same or similar state' looks very plausible to me.<br><br>- It seems to me that specifically the words 'sun, moon, heaven', and 'earth' go without articles in both Sindarin and Quenya, as far as it can be made out: <i>bo Ceven, vi Menel, Anar kaluva, Menel Kemenye, Ráno tie</i> etc.<br>However, in the context of the Tinúviel poem, <i>ir</i> as a definite article makes more sense to me because of the following <i>si</i>: *'The moon shines [...] Now listen [...]' rather than *'When the moon shines [...] now listen'. Why do would you start with a temporal clause and then say 'now' in the main clause?<br>In any case, we also have <i>i úgerth</i> with a singular article before a plural noun, so I'd say there is still the possibility that <i>ir Ellath</i> has the singular article <i>i</i> before a plural noun, but it becomes <i>ir</i> before the vowel; and the same happens in <i>ir Ithil</i>.<br><br>- Speaking of which, perhaps <i>il</i> in <i>il chem</i> might also be a form of the article rather than the suggested 'all' from IL-?<br>Interestingly, the mentioned <i>îr</i> < <i>eryā</i> (VT50:18) actually runs again a lot of other attested diphthongizations like <i>eir, air</i> < <i>eryā</i> (PE17:28), <i>teleir</i> < <i>teleryā</i> (PE17:139) etc (unless it's one of the semi-regular unstressed reductions). Therefore, I would have expected <i>ilyā</i> 'all' to become <i>*eil, *ail</i>.<br>Of course, S. <i>il</i> might just be the cognate of Q. <i>illi</i> 'all' rather than <i>ilya</i>, but it's still odd to see it preceding the noun, where the article would normally be.</div>

        <div class="content">Roman, note that if the (uncertain) letters preceding "il chem" do in fact read "a?l", they might have been *<i>ail</i> < *<i>ilyā</i>, which of course would lend even more support to construing <i>il</i> as meaning 'all' (direct from IL-). This possibility occurred to me while writing the analysis, but since the deleted word is so uncertain, and since <i>il</i> as 'all' seems unproblematic, I didn't make mention of it. </div>

        <div class="content">Roman writes: "it's still odd to see [S. il] preceding the noun, where the article would normally be." Statements like this portray a certainty about "Sindarin" that the actual evidence cannot support. The syntax of "Sindarin" is so sparsely attested — and is moreover chiefly poetic — that what is "usual" for it cannot reasonably be assumed or asserted for most categories. And that is true even if we think of all the attested "Sindarin" texts as in fact reflecting a single, mutually-consistent conceptual system — which of course is <i>not</i> the case.</div>

        <div class="content">Carl, indeed I figured you had done so! I assumed that if there were an explanation somewhere, it would lie in unpublished material, or some link to another language (cp. the analyses of <i>ach</i> and <i>eithro</i> in VT50), not the already-published material. That said, I am already about to reread all the material as I jump back in for the first time in years, so it wouldn't hurt to keep an eye out for anything remotely relevant to VT50.<br><br>As for <i>ed</i> and <i>han</i>, I think my confusion stemmed from the prevalent usage of <i>han</i> in neo-Sindarin as a 3rd sg. impersonal object (cp. Salo's <i>Han mathon</i>, etc.), from before PE17's publication. This was so rooted in my mind that I didn't recall PE17:42's more specific explanation of <i>hain echant</i> that <i>han</i> is 'that' and <i>hain</i> 'those, them, the things previously mentioned' rather than 3rd sg. impersonal. Given this notion of <i>han</i>, I was puzzled when Tolkien used <i>ed</i>; my mentions of <i>then</i> / <i>hen</i> were meant to tie into the same discussion of those in VT50 and link usage of <i>han/hain</i> to the same chronology as the Wrapper. However, as you point out, <i>han/hain</i> do not have the meaning I thought they did. This is what happens when I rely on memory and don't consult the proper sources; I shall be more careful in the future. :)</div>
