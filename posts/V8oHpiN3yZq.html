        <div class="content"><strong>A Psalmist Wordlist</strong><br>To support my work on translating the Book of Psalms, I've built a specific wordlist on Google Sheets, which identifies all words I've been using, whether attested or not.<br><br>Attested words can be found in column A (or column B for unattested orthographies). Their attested declensions are in column H, and their unattested declensions in column J.<br><br>Neologisms of any kind are in column L, with their declensions in column P. Most of them are self-explanatory, but notes have been added to explain the few that need it.<br><br>A self-measure of the quality of these neologisms is in column R (see the "Presentation" tab for details). Any grade below 4 is really poor, and I'd be interested in any suggestion to change those words.<br><br>Feel free to send me corrections or comments.

I agree that 'lend' would be a basic verb in Q (not in the verb-class sense but as a semantic entity); however, we don't know how Tolkien would've formed it (would it be related to a root meaning 'release'? 'loose'? 'yield'? 'give'? or something new?) so my thought was that for now it's safer to resort to a phrase instead of coming up with a compound.<br>Having said that, I am starting to warm to your <i>*lúmelav-</i>; after all, 'timeshare' is a thing in English.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> I don't really agree with your comment that other derivates from DAGA fit with derivates from later NDAK-: as far as I can tell, only Q. <i>nahta</i> is in this case. Yet your concern is right and raise an important point, as my derivation can't fit with root NDAK-. It would be a perfect fit for the phonological rules of Early Qenya, but no longer correct in the frame of the "Outline of Phonology".<br><br>From E.T. <i>jagula</i> and comparison with E.T. <i>tagula</i> (derived from E.Prim. <i>dagla</i>, we can complete and update the E.Prim. word <i>dịag</i> from which <i>jagula</i> is supposed to derive: it should be in fact. <i>*dịag-la</i> (or more precisely <i>*dịag-lā</i>). Hence, two possibilities: if we consider that the new root still is (N)DAK- (as in Etym.) rather than NDAK-, then the initial would become <i>l-</i> in Q. I'll avoid this option, as the later version of the root is always said to be NDAK-, with no Q. words that could be traced to an alternate *DAK-, as far as I can tell.<br><br>If we choose to stick with the later attestations of the root, the primitive word can only be <i>*ndịak-lā</i>. At this stage, we know that <i>kl</i> groups are changed, either by insertion of a vowel whose quality is the same as the previous vowel: this would give Q. <i>*nyacal(a)</i>. In some (unspecified) cases, a metathesis can occur: this would give Q. <i>*nyalca</i>. I tend to prefer the later one for brevity reasons, but your advice would be appreciated, especially since this type of metathesis is said to be a non-systematic sound-change.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> Your last comment is cryptic for me: as you label E.T. <i>jagula</i> a noun (and I tend to agree), I would have expected that your comments concerned the noun, not the verb (which I actually derive from the recontructed noun).</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#damien-bador">Damien Bador</a> what I meant was that under the "updated" root NDAK the Eldarin verb (and consequently the late Quenya verb) "to sacrifice" could have the same relationship to the Eldarin verb "to slay, kill" as under the early root DAGA. And yes indeed, the same applies to the noun as you have rightly pointed out.</div>
