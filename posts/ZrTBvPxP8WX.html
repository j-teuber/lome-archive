        <div class="content">This is a great experiment. I have heard that if children learn a new language before the age of seven, they will speak it without an accent, so they would be "fluent" with the accent they were taught. Small children can easily learn more than one language. It would be very interesting to me to see how Quenya and Sindarin would evolve considering the children's native language. I bet they would fill in a lot of words for us. </div>

If, for instance, we folks from the community sequestered ourselves somewhere to do nothing but learn and talk Eldarin, we would constantly worry about things like attestation and consistency; but the children would simply use the language as they'd see fit.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#tamas-ferencz">Tamas Ferencz</a> Actually, we (my wife and I) tried to teach Quenya not in a nursery school, but in an online virtual school (mostly for the fantasy fans). There were many children in there — not too small children, though, but still. The interest to the language was really great. However, we have two stumbling blocks that prevent us from continuing: the "attested/unattested" (and, consequently, "correct/incorrect") thing you mentioned and... copyrights. For instance, I had asked about what is copyrighted and what is not because I don't want to be suited because of a Tengwar inscription or a Quenya word somewhere.</div>

        <div class="content">+<a class="mention" href="/lome-archive/tags.html#andre-polykanine">Andre Polykanine</a><br>well. I am not a lawyer - and this is no legal advice. My understanding (or maybe just my wishful thinking!) is that Tolkien's names, characters (and of course the text of his works beyond fair use) are copyrighted, but the languages (grammar, structure, vocab) themselves aren't. But I may be sorely mistaken in this, in which case someone please come and correct me - I would not want to perpetuate fallacies.</div>
